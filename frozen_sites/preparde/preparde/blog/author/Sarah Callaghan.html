The PREPARDE project officially finished with a final project meeting on Friday 23rd August, 2013. However, work on the topic of data publication is still in full swing, mainly through the <a class="ext-link" href="https://rd-alliance.org/internal-groups/publishing-data-ig.html"><span class="icon"> </span>Publishing Data Interest Group</a> of the Research Data Alliance.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, our project deliverables are being put up on the <a href="../../wiki/DeliverablesList.html">Deliverables page</a> and the slides from the final meeting have been attached to this post.
</p>
<p>
I'd like to thank all the project team and all the other interested people who have given so generously of their time and energy to interact with us on this project and in our workshops. Here's hoping we can work together again on this topic soon!

      <p>
The third and final workshop for the PREPARDE project was held at Rutherford Appleton Laboratory on the 30th April 2013. It was well attended with over 30 participants and a lot of excellent presentations and discussion on the workshop themes of how to manage workflows for data publication, and how to effectively link between datasets and the papers that cite them. 
</p>
<p>
All the presentations given are now available on the workshop webpage at <a href="../../wiki/CrosslinkingWorkshop.html">http://proj.badc.rl.ac.uk/preparde/wiki/CrosslinkingWorkshop</a>
</p>
<p>
One theme that I noticed coming around several times was that of needing a central registry or broker to manage the flow of information between the data repositories and the data journals. As the moment, the beginnings of this exist in the form of the DataCite metadata store, where repositories deposit the DOI specific metadata, which can then be retrieved by the journal publisher. What is needed is a mechanism for the reverse to happen - i.e. a place for the journal to push the information that a dataset has been cited to, and where a repository can query/pull that citation information from. 
</p>
<p>
Data citation as a mechanism for cross-linking also came up several times, with the general feeling of "if it ain't broke, don't fix it!" The consensus (at least in my breakout group) was that citation is a well-established, well-used and well-understood mechanism for linking between articles, so we can piggy-back on that to expand its use to linking datasets to articles as well. 
</p>
<p>
We all took copious notes from our breakout and discussion session, which are in the process of being written up now. Once they're tidied up, they too will be added to the workshop webpage.
</p>
<p>
I'd like to thank again our wonderful presenters (some of whom even came from abroad!) and our participants for their active engagement and their insights at the workshop. We really appreciate it!

As mentioned in our previous post, members of the PREPARDE team attended the European Geophysical Union General Assembly in Vienna, and presented the project at a splinter meeting and in an oral presentation on Friday 12th April.
</p>
<p>
The splinter meeting went well (aside from me accidentally dumping a glass of water onto my poor colleague!) We had a number of attendees who gave us lots of food for thought and feedback on our proposed guidelines for peer review of data and repository accreditation, so many thanks to them! 
</p>
<p>
Both documents are still open for comment, and all comments are welcome!

The data publication <a class="ext-link" href="http://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2013/orals/11680"><span class="icon"> </span>oral session</a> itself was very interesting, with Hans Pfeiffenberger highlighting in particular some of the issues that [ESSD <a class="ext-link" href="http://www.earth-system-science-data.net/"><span class="icon"> </span>http://www.earth-system-science-data.net/</a>] have experienced in their many years of operating a data journal. We also had excellent talks from Kerstin Lehnert about disciplinary repositories and their role in data publication and David Marques about Elsevier's work in cross-linking publications with research data.
</p>
<p>
The <a class="ext-link" href="http://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2013/posters/11680"><span class="icon"> </span>poster session</a>, though thin on the ground, did provide a lot to think about too.

<p>
The workshop will be held at <a class="ext-link" href="http://www.stfc.ac.uk/About+STFC/51.aspx"><span class="icon"> </span>Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Didcot, UK</a> on Tuesday the 30th April.
</p>
<p>
More information about the workshop is below:
</p>
<p>
Linking datasets and articles for publication – cross-linking and workflows
Data is being increasingly recognised as the foundation of the scientific record. Data journals and other data publishing models (such as enhanced publications) are opening up data and other research products for further use, re-use and validation. A key part of data publication, and linking data to other scientific outputs, is a formalised and standardised method of permanently cross-linking between the dataset (as held in a repository) and the related article (as hosted in a journal).
</p>
<p>
The PREPARDE project is funded by JISC to address key issues arising from data publication, including cross-linking between repository and journal. It aims to produce guidelines applicable to a wide range of scientific disciplines and data publication models. The project initially focuses on earth science disciplines, and the Geoscience Data Journal, a partnership between the Royal Meteorological Society and Wiley-Blackwell.
</p>
<p>
Intended audience: the workshop will interest anyone involved in publishing data, either directly, via a data journal or as part of an enhanced publication
</p>
<p>
Critical issues the workshop aims to cover include:
</p>
<ul><li>How can publishers and repositories collaborate to exploit and share metadata about related scientific outputs (i.e. datasets and articles)
</li><li>Where are the best points in the various journal and repository workflows to establish persistent links and share metadata for data publication?
</li></ul><p>
Participating in the workshop will help you to: 
</p>
<ol><li>Understand benefits and risks to stakeholders in scholarly publishing likely to arise from different data publishing models.
</li><li>Shape PREPARDE project guidelines on:- a) workflows for data publication b) data and metadata standards for enabling cross-linking between data repositories and academic publishers.
</li></ol><p>
Please do pass these details on to other interested parties, and please do contact me (sarah.callaghan@…) if you have any questions.

    </h1>
    <div class="blog-body">
      <p>
The <a class="ext-link" href="https://www.openaire.eu/en/component/content/article/9-news-events/432"><span class="icon"> </span>OpenAIRE Interoperability Workshop</a> was held at the University of Minho, Portugal, on the 7/8 February 2013. I was there, wearing a number of different hats. Firstly, as a member of the OpenAIREplus team, secondly, presenting about PREPARDE and our work on workflows and cross-linking, and thirdly as a data scientist and repository manager. 
</p>
<p>
My presentation was videoed and can be seen on the <a class="ext-link" href="http://vimeo.com/channels/openaireworkshop2/59741033"><span class="icon"> </span>OpenAIRE Vimeo channel</a>. I've attached my slides to this blog post too.
</p>
<p>
I made it to the workshop on the first day (after a few hiccups with broken planes) just in time for the session on Open Science, Open Data and Repositories, which was part of the University of Minho's Open Access Seminar. This was a really good session for introducing people to key concepts about open data and open access, and even gave us a bit of a history lesson too about how this whole scientific publishing thing got started. (I never knew quite how pivotal <a class="ext-link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Oldenburg"><span class="icon"> </span>Henry Oldenburg</a> was - not only was he the founding editor of the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, but he also pretty much invented the process of pre-publication peer-review.)
</p>
<p>
The session on OpenAIREplus was also really useful for getting a feel about what OpenAIRE are trying to do to extend their services to include research data, especially in the case where it's linked directly to publications*. Discussions about this were continued on the following day in a splinter group talking about the proposed OpenAIRE guidelines for Data Archive Managers.
</p>
<p>
I'm very glad to see that these guidelines are based around the <a class="ext-link" href="http://schema.datacite.org"><span class="icon"> </span>DataCite metadata schema</a>, tying in nicely with the work we're doing at BADC and the general direction data citation seems to be going at the moment. The plan is to dig out some case studies of data sets linked to published papers, and I have a couple in mind already, one of which relates to my (very soon to be published) GDJ paper.
</p>
<p>
OpenAIRE and PREPARDE have a lot of shared interests, so it was very nice to be able to connect with them at this event, and even start talking about what should come next by way of data publication and article-data linking in the future. The calls for Horizon 2020 will be out soon...
</p>
<hr />
<p>
*I'm a bit wary of this, as it's almost putting data as second class citizens in comparison to articles, but I do appreciate they have to limit the scope of the project somehow in order to get stuff done.

    </h1>
    <div class="blog-body">
      <p>
IDCC13 was an important conference for the PREPARDE team, not just because we had an oral presentation in the Data Publication session, but also because it was the venue for the first of our three project workshops.
</p>
<p>
As always, the conference was very well attended, and digital technology and social media were used to enable those who weren't there physically to at least follow along. Videos of the keynote speeches, blog posts and storifys of tweets can all be found on the conference <a class="ext-link" href="http://www.dcc.ac.uk/events/idcc13"><span class="icon"> </span>homepage</a>.
</p>
<p>
The PREPARDE presentation was titled "Processes and Procedures for Data Publication: a case study in the Geosciences" and raised a lot of interest (<a class="ext-link" href="http://www.dcc.ac.uk/webfm_send/1133"><span class="icon"> </span>slides can be downloaded here</a>) - in fact at that stage of the data publication session I noticed that it was standing room only at the back! Angus Whyte (a PREPARDE team member) has written an excellent overview and summary of the whole session that can be found <a class="ext-link" href="http://www.dcc.ac.uk/blog/idcc13-data-publication-generating-trust-around-data-sharing"><span class="icon"> </span>here</a>.
</p>
<p>
Thursday 17th January was the PREPARDE workshop, titled: "Data publishing, peer review and repository accreditation: everyone a winner?" (which I've been reliably informed was the first IDCC13 workshop to be sold out). The main focus for this workshop was on the tricky issue of repository accreditation, which was addressed by presenters from a wide variety of viewpoints, including, but not limited to publishers, professional societies and data repository managers. The slides are available <a class="ext-link" href="http://www.dcc.ac.uk/events/idcc13/workshops"><span class="icon"> </span>here</a> (scroll down the page to find the workshop title and agenda) and I created a storify of the tweets sent during the workshop <a class="ext-link" href="http://storify.com/sorcha_ni/preparde-workshop-at-idcc13"><span class="icon"> </span>here</a>.
</p>
<p>
Angus and his DCC colleague Alex Ball took loads of notes during the workshop, and a full workshop report will be coming out soon. I'd like to take the opportunity again to thank all of our excellent speakers, and the workshop attendees for their lively input into our discussions during the day!

    </h1>
    <div class="blog-body">
      <p>
The PREPARDE project hosted a town hall meeting at the AGU Fall meeting last week, titled: "TH32F. Publishing Research Data: Peer Review, Data Center Accreditation, and Linking", which was sponsored by ESSI. 
</p>
<p>
The description of the meeting was:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Data publication is an increasingly important mechanism for incentivising the sharing of research data. The PREPARDE (Peer Review for Publication &amp; Accreditation of Research Data in the Earth sciences) is working with academic institutions, learned societies, data centers and commercial publishers to investigate barriers and drivers to data publishing and sharing, peer review, and re-use of geoscientific datasets. This town hall meeting will provide an overview of the project?s progress to date and invite input from anyone interested in developing long-term sustainable policies, processes, incentives and business models for managing and publishing research data. Key project partners, the publishers and Board Members of the Geoscience Data Journal will also be available for informal discussions.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
We had an excellent attendance, with an audience of over 60 people, varying from librarians and data managers to scientific researchers and data producers. We had some very interesting discussions after the project team had done their brief presentation (see slides attached to this post) - a lot of which spilled out into the corridor after the allotted hour for the Town Hall meeting had finished!
</p>
<p>
I got the distinct impression that data publication is of interest to a lot of people. There was some balking at the notion of using data papers as a method for giving credit to the data producers and managers for their hard work (and to a certain extent I agree, but until we can convince the powers that be that datasets are valuable entities <em>in their own right</em>, we're a bit stuck and have to piggyback on existing article publication methods). 
</p>
<p>
Some areas (like the <a class="ext-link" href="http://nsidc.org/"><span class="icon"> </span>National Snow and Ice Data Center</a> ) already have their own processes in place to review and publish information about the data held in their archives (an example is 
<a class="ext-link" href="http://nsidc.org/data/docs/daac/mod10a1_modis_terra_snow_daily_global_500m_grid.gd.html"><span class="icon"> </span>here</a>), which is excellent - and we in no way want to replace these! Instead we want to offer publication options for those subject areas which aren't as well served, or for those data stored in institutional repositories, where data review might not be possible for the repository managers due to the lack of domain knowledge.
</p>
<p>
We're still at the early stages of writing our guidelines, but it is gratifying to know that what we're doing is of interest to so many people, and to have so many willing volunteers already to act as reviewers!
</p>
<p>
(p.s. I've also attached the slides I used for my presentation in the session IN22A. Data Stewardship, Citation With Confidence, and Preparing Next Generation of Data Managers, as they too are related to the project)

We don't want to reinvent the wheel when it comes to writing guidelines for data journals, hence it makes sense to see what's out there in terms of pre-exisiting data journals, and what their guidelines are.

Below is a (non-exhaustive, in no particular order) list of the data journals we know of, either through personal experience or through internet searches.

<p>
Journal of Physical and Chemical Reference Data is published by the American Institute of Physics (AIP) for the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST); content is published online daily, collected into quarterly online and printed issues (4 issues per year). The objective of the Journal is to provide critically evaluated physical and chemical property data, fully documented as to the original sources and the criteria used for evaluation, preferably with uncertainty analysis. Critical reviews of measurement techniques may also be included if they shed light on the accuracy of available data in a technical area. Papers reporting correlations of data or estimation methods are acceptable only if they are based on critical data evaluation and if they produce “reference data”—the best available values for the relevant properties. The journal is not intended as a publication outlet for original experimental measurements such as those normally reported in the primary research literature, nor for review articles of a descriptive or primarily theoretical nature.

Peer Review and hosting Datasets from Data Papers
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
It is the intent of IJRR to solicit archival quality data, which means that all aspects of the Data Paper and associated dataset will be peer reviewed. Our aim is to provide an archival service to authors, however this is an ongoing process, and while we aim  ultimately to host all datasets and their supporting websites, it is anticipated that initially many data papers will refer to websites hosted and author managed.

<strong>Aims and Scope</strong> 
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Ubiquity Press metajournals provide a fully open access way to discover research resources that are spread across multiple locations and usually hard to find. 
Metapapers reward authors for openly archiving their research datasets, software and reports, through citation and impact tracking. The publications encourage new and more efficient research, new collaborations, and reuse by the public (e.g. for teaching and journalism).
UP metapapers come in three flavours:
</p>
</blockquote>
<ul><li>Data papers highlight openly archived data with high reuse potential, and provide recognition for the producers of the data.
</li><li>Software papers help you to locate openly archived, reusable code relevant to your research, and provide a mechanism for citing its use.
</li><li>Research reports provide concise summaries of key developments in a field that the community do not otherwise have access to.
</li></ul><blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
All papers are peer reviewed to ensure that the associated resources have been archived in suitable repositories, according to appropriate open standards. 
</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>Repository Criteria</strong>

    </h1>
    <div class="blog-body">
      <p>
As the project manager, I've spent a lot of my time recently sorting out things which will (hopefully) help the project to run smoothly. So, besides the usual project and workpackage plan, I've got this site and blog set up and have introduced the team to a few other things I've found useful.
</p>
<ul><li>Every project needs good communications, and having a project-specific mailing list is definitely the way to go, as it's one convenient place to send emails to all the partners, without having to make sure everyone's name is in the "To:" field. I use JISCmail (<a class="ext-link" href="http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/"><span class="icon"> </span>http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/</a>) which is free for members of the academic and research communities, and has never given me any problems.
</li></ul><ul><li>Trying to find a good date and time for meetings/teleconferences is always tricky. I use Doodle (<a class="ext-link" href="http://doodle.com/"><span class="icon"> </span>http://doodle.com/</a>) to set up sets of dates that people can then express a preference on. Yes, it's a commercial service, but it's free for basic use. I also like their yes/no/maybe options for responses to the poll.
</li></ul><ul><li>At the moment, we're mainly passing documents around via email, which isn't ideal because of lack of version control etc. (though with only a few people working on the documents at any time, it's manageable). Later on, I'm expecting to make a bit more use of Google Docs (now Google Drive <a class="ext-link" href="https://drive.google.com"><span class="icon"> </span>https://drive.google.com</a>) to share and edit documents on-line.
</li></ul><ul><li>We've got partners spread out across the UK and also in the USA as well, so a key part of our interactions are through the monthly teleconference. We've used skype (and use it for the weekly project management chat) though the sound quality can be variable, so we've also used a commercial teleconference system. Jury's still out for this particular tool!
</li></ul><ul><li>For keeping track of my "things to do", I use a combination of pen and paper (no need to worry about batteries) and flags and appointments in my Outlook. I have had Remember the Milk (<a class="ext-link" href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/"><span class="icon"> </span>http://www.rememberthemilk.com/</a>) recommended as a good tool for managing the to-do list.
</li></ul><ul><li>Finally, this site is itself is a wiki, and all the project partners are encouraged to create and edit pages as needed. We still need to sort out a proper, secure, project document repository for all our working documents, but in the meantime, we'll keep building this site as a first stop for information about the project.
</li></ul><p>
So, that's my tools and tips for running a project. If anyone knows of any others, I'd love to hear about them!

This is just a quick test post to say hello and welcome to the PREPARDE project blog. 
</p>
<p>
The project kicked off at the beginning of July, and we're currently getting started on a lot of interesting work and discussions around our main project themes of scientific peer-review of data, cross-linking between datasets and papers, accreditation of data repositories and workflows for data publication. 
</p>
<p>
In other words, there's not a lot here yet, but there will be!
