   <h2>Comments on disclosure of data and software</h2>

   <p>It has been argued <a class="external" href="http://www.climateaudit.org/?p=886">e.g. on Stephen McIntyre's website</a>
that all computer code and data used to generate published results should
be published. We emphasise that we agree with the
viewpoint expressed in the recent report on Surface Temperature
reconstructions for the Last 2,000 Years, published by the National
Research Council (NRC) (copies are available from the National Academies Press,
500 Fifth Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20001; (800) 624-6242); namely that "all
research benefits from full and open access to published datasets and
that a clear explanation of analytical methods is mandatory". However,
as also pointed out in the NRC report; "access to research data is a
complicated, discipline-dependent issue, and ... access to computer
models and methods is especially challenging because intellectual
property rights must be considered". These conditions explain why open
access to raw paleoclimate data, or computer code, has not always been a
rule in the past. The NRC report further recognised that some open data
archives actually do exist, in particular the International Tree Ring
Data Bank and the World Data Center for Paleoclimatology. It will still
take time before scientists have adopted a general habit of always
publishing data and methods on such open data banks. The following
outlook, as phrased in the NRC report, would be a step in that direction
if their recommendation is followed up and implemented: "Paleoclimate
research would benefit if individual researchers, professional
societies, journal editors, and funding agencies continued to improve
their efforts to ensure that these existing open access practices are
followed".</p>
