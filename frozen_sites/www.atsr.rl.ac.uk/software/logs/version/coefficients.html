<h2>Sadist-2 coefficients</h2>
<p>The coefficients represent a linear regression of SST on brightness temperature.  In practice, 
regression is based on model brightness temperatures derived from an ensemble of
atmospheric profiles using a Radiative Transfer Model.  The coefficients used for ATSR
processing are based on RAL model RADGEN.</p>
<p>The following steps are involved in coefficient derivation:</p>
<p><blockquote>Generate ensemble of atmospheric profiles </blockquote></p>
<p><blockquote>Profile set should be statistically representative </blockquote> </p>
<p><blockquote>Run radiative transfer model (RADGEN) to derive brightness temperatures for each profile </blockquote></p>
<p><blockquote> Derive regression coefficients of surface temperature vs. brightness temperatures </blockquote></p>
<p><blockquote>Impose constraints at this stage if stratospheric aerosol robust coefficients required </blockquote></p>
<BR>
<p> The coefficient derivation depends on an ensemble of atmospheric profiles, RADGEN version and auxiliary data. </p>
