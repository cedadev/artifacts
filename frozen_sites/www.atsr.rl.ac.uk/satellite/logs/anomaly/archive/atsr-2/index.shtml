<h2>ATSR-2 Status :-</h2>
<P>Under normal circumstances ATSR-2 operates under ERS-2 Mission Planning rules 
  in a very systematic configuration. An overview of these mission planning rules, 
  as far as they affect ATSR-2, is given <A href="../../../../../documentation/docs/userguide/index.shtml">in 
  the user guide</A>, sections 5.3 to 5.5.</P>
<P>If for any reason the instrument is unable to follow the mission plan then 
  behind the following table of dates is a short description of the problem.. 
  These events relate to the instrument status and not necessarily to data availability.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<hr>
<H3> 15th April 2002 </H3>
<P>ICU reset at ~07:30 UTC followed by restart of MWR and GOME and IRR cool down at ~12.40 UTC, the restart
went smoothly and the instrument was commanded to NOMINAL at 17:26:40 UTC.  The auto gain/offset loops 
operating correctly. </P>
  
<H3> 16th January 2002 </H3>     
<P>Whilst ESOC commission EXTRA-BACKUP-MODE (an attitude control mode planned for
NO-gyro operation) the instrument pointing will be degraded, these activities
commenced at 016:06:30:00 UTC and are expected to be completed by 
019:17:00:00 UTC. </P>
<P>The ATSR-2 IRR will remain on during those activities and it's expected that
 co-location of forward/nadir views in the data processing will be affected .</P>	 

 <H3> 12th Apil 2002 </H3>
 <P>Instrument operations request #127 prepared to request ATSR-2 instruments to STANDBY followed by an ICU
 reset and restart for Monday 15th April.  The IRR continues running with the gains/offsets set at default
 values. </P>
 
<H3> 11th April 2002 </H3>
<P>Due to an on-board anomaly the ATSR-2 instrument suffered an emergency switch down at 101:02:18:48 UTC.
Recovery of the IRR instrument began at approx. 16:00 UTC with cool down and operation complete by 23:00 UTC.
However, it was noticed that the auto gain/offset loops were frozen as has been seen before. </P>
 
<H3> 21st March 2002 </H3>
<P>The ATSR-2 IRR detector cool down took place on 21/03/02 and the instrument operation returned
to nominal at 080:18:50:41 UTC.</P>
  
   
<H3> 20th March 2002 </H3> 
   <P>The payload shutdown and subsequent safe mode were caused by a problem with the
   RA instrument ICU data-bus.  The platform is now out of safe-mode.  Troubleshooting
   the RA problem today was successful and the rest of the payload will be switched
   on.  ATSR-2 switch on and return to operation is expected on 21/03/02.</P>
 
<H3> 8th March 2002 </H3>
<p>A platform anomaly occurred at 067:03:29:03 UTC which caused a payload shutdown.  The reacquisition
   of nominal platform steering is still ongoing as of early Tuesday 12th March. </p>


<H3> 28/29th November 2001 </H3>
<p> ATSR-2 IRR reconfiguration began at 332:21:05:00 UTC.  All went nominally and the instrument
was nominal by 333:10:55:46 UTC. </p>

<H3> 27th November 2001 </H3>
<p>Due to ESOC planned requirements for 1 Gyro Coarse Mode Commissioning the whole payload
was shut down at 331:08:39 UTC. </p>

<H3> 19th November 2001 </H3>
<p> ATSR-2 IRR reconfiguration began at 323:18:00 UTC all went smoothly and the instrument was 
nominal by approx. 324:00:30 UTC.  The auto gain/offset loops are functioning correctly now. </p>
<p> During the restart the SCC cooler amplitude was increased by two command steps.  This is
the first SCC change since launch.  </p>

<H3> 17th November 2001 </H3>
<p>ERS-2 payload shut down at 321:17:30 UTC to make safe during the Leonids meteor storm.</p>

<H3> 04th September 2001 </H3>
<p> Reconfiguration and cool down of the IRR began at 248:09:15 UTC.  The instrument reconfiguration was
completed by 248:16:30 UTC, however, the instrument auto gain/offset loops were seen to be 'stuck' 
(again). </p>
<p> It was agreed to leave the instrument in this state at this time after sample NRT products had been
analysed to show that the default gains and offsets were producing good data with no sign of saturation..</p>

<H3> 03rd September 2001 </H3>
<p>  During recovery of the RA instrument after an earlier anomaly the ERS-2 payload and ATSR-2 
suffered a shut down, this occurred at approx. 247:08:45 UTC. </p>

<H3> 11th June 2001 </H3>
<p> On orbit nr. 32110 the IRR Auto gain/offset loops were disabled at 162:07:26:40 for 1023 scans whilst
descending over the Arabian Peninsular.  The purpose of this test was to characterise the IR channel
operation over hot land surfaces. </p>

<H3> 06th June 2001 </H3>
<p>Platform AOCS using <b>ZGM</b> mode (Zero Gyro Mode)</p>

<H3> 01st June 2001 </H3>
<p> ESOC begin a campaign of AOCS testing to improve the YSM steering, the impact will be
continued lack of H/R data for the IRR whilst global wind/wave data products are taken to be
used for YSM performance characterisation. </p>

<H3> 29th May 2001 </H3>
<P> After difficutly re-installing the platform attitude control mode, ATSR-IRR finally was 
reconfigured on 29th May when the start up and cool down went uneventfully with a return to nominal 
operation at 149:15:40 UTC. </p>
  
<H3> 21st May 2001 </H3>
<P> Due to  platform anomaly the ERS-2 payload was turned off at 141:18:12:31 UTC.  Recovery will 
involve coarse attitude mode and 3 gyro pointing in order to re-instate EBM attitude control. </P> 

<H3> 30th March 2001 </H3>
<P> ERS-2 attitude and orbit control system (AOCS) software updated with the new yaw
steering control mode known as EBM-YSM.  This took place around 089:10:30 UTC.  Co-location of
ATSR imagery should be improved. </P> 

<H3> 24th March 2001 </H3>
<P> Pixel read/write anomaly at 083:05:58:16 UTC. </P> 

<H3> 12th February 2001 </H3>
<P> 65.7w power spike at 043:22:24:55 UTC, an isolated event. </P> 

<H3> 9th February 2001 </H3>
<P>ATSR-2 was successfully restarted at 11:43 on 8 February after being
      off for almost three weeks.  The cooldown to 80K was completed at 07:49 on
      9 February and is now back to nominal operations. </P>
      <P> The ERS-2 spacecraft attitude is operating in Extra-Backup-Mode (i.e.
      no gyros).  This will have a significant effect on ATSR-2 images, in particular 
      the co-location of nadir and along-track views.  ESA hope to improve  the performance
      of the attitude control as the orbit behaviour becomes more understood.  The aim is to
      attain optimum attitude control by June in readiness for the launch of ENVISAT-1
      in July.  To provide data for the orbit analysis, ESA will run the AMI instrument
      in wind-wave mode for an extended period.  This means that there will be no ATSR-2
      H-Rate data until 16 February (TBC). </P> 

<H3> 2nd February 2001 </H3>
<P>ESOC's efforts to establish a stable Emergency Back-up Mode (EBM) attitude
      control of the spacecraft platform using <B>no</B> gyros has not been
      without problems.  Whilst EBM tests continue it is still not possible to operate
      the payload.</P>
       <P>It is expected that return of ATSR-2 IRR operation will not be before
       Monday 5th February.</P>

<H3> 26th January 2001 </H3>
<P>ERS-2 payload still remains unavailable.  ESOC's efforts to reconfigure
      the spacecraft platform have taken longer than expected. </P>
       <P>Payload operations are not now expected to restart before the end
       of the weekend at the earliest.</P>

<H3> 19th January 2001 </H3>
<P>At 017:19:53:00 UTC there has been a payload shutdown. </P>

<H3> 16th January 2001 </H3>
<P>Whilst ESOC commission EXTRA-BACKUP-MODE (an attitude control mode planned for
      NO-gyro operation) the instrument pointing will be degraded, these activities
      commenced at 016:06:30:00 UTC and are expected to be completed by 
      019:17:00:00 UTC. </P>
      <P>The ATSR-2 IRR will remain on during those activities and it's expected that
      co-location of forward/nadir views in the data processing will be affected .</P>	 


<H3> 5th December 2000 </H3>
<P>ERS-2 platform was in FPM between 340:13:09:46 UTC and 341:03:24:52 UTC
      whilst orbit control manoeuvres were executed.  Co-location of fotward/nadir
      views in the data processing will be affected. </P>

<H3> 2nd November 2000 </H3>
<P>Platform coarse mode attitude control was reconfigured in the period
      307:10:26:02 UTC through 307:17:08:26 UTC during this time YSM was replaced
      by FPM and consequently forward/nadir views in data processed will be affected </P>

<H3> 25th October 2000 </H3>
 <P>Due to Gyro 6 becoming noisy, Fine Pointing Mode was initiated at
      	298:16:00:54 UTC.  After platform reconfiguration Yaw Steering Mode was
	re-instated at 299:12:08:06 UTC.</P>
      <P>For this period of approximately 20 hours ATSR data products will have
      anomalous geo-location.</P>

<H3> 12th October 2000 </H3>
      <P>ERS-2 platform is now operational again using mono-gyro steering.</P>
      <P>Reactivation of ATSR IRR began Wednesday afternoon, however, time
         ran out before the detector cool down could begin with an anticipated
	 return to nominal before the last Kiruna pass for the day.</P>
     <P>Detector cool down began at 09:00 UTC today, Thursday 12th October, and
     	it is now expected that the instrument operation will be nominal by
	approximately 15.30 UTC. </P>

<H3>7th October 2000 </H3>
  <P>On Saturday 7th October at 17:30:49 UTC the ERS-2 platform suffered an
      attitude anomaly and, as a consequence, all the payload instruments are
      powered off whilst recovery takes place.</P>
      <P>ESOC estimate ATSR should be powered up again on Wednesday 11th October, pm.</P>
    
 <H3>8th August 2000</H3>
  <p>Due to an ATSR software anomaly, the instrument was shut down autonomously on 
   08/08/2000 at 221:11:47:45 UTC.  A recovery was started later in the day after 
   an instrument power cycling and the instrument was nominal again by 222.01:27:27 UTC.
  </p>
   <p>However, there will need to be a further ICU reset and instrument restart when time is 
   available (Kiruna Ground Station is occupied by the Cluster II Launch 
   activities on 9th August).</p>
  <H3>11th July 2000</H3>
<p>The ATSR-IRR instrument was fully recovered to nominal operation at 17:00 UTC
on 6th July 2000. </p>
 <p> Further difficulties with the payload were encountered yesterday, 10th July 2000,
 at 16:32:47 UTC, when all the instruments were switched off again. </p>
 <p> Recovery of the payload has commenced today, 11th July 2000, and it is 
 expected that the ATSR-IRR will be back to nominal later. </p>
<H3>30th June 2000</H3><P>Since Friday 30th June at 182:06:43:00 UTC all payload instruments are
      	 switched off due to a platform anomaly.</P>
      <P>The Problem is under investigation by ESA. </P>
