<p> This is a 12 micron thermal image, showing the continued break-up of the
B-15 iceberg with significant developments over the summer months.  Note how far
apart B-15A and B-15B have become and how B-15A has swung out into the Ross Sea
as it runs into Ross Island.  It is also interesting to see that B-15B has moved
further out into the Ross Sea, making its way towards ice free waters of the
Southern Ocean.  The question is - will it escape before the winter freeze sets 
in? </p>

                of the Antarctic Peninsula. The dividing line between the
                ice shelf and the sea ice is clearly visible running from
                the bottom right up through the centre of the image. The
                oval-shaped piece of ice at the northern extremity of the 
                ice shelf is a large iceberg formed from the disintegration
                of part of the shelf. This iceberg, about the size of 
                Oxfordshire, was first seen in February 1995 and has since 
                moved approximately 50km further north.

<p>This is a false colour image, produced using brightness
                temperatures from one of ATSR-2's thermal infra-red 
                detectors (11.0 micron).</p>

<p>                The image was obtained from ATSR-2's nadir view, during a 
                day-time pass of the Canary Islands. </p>

<p>                The hottest areas (shown in black) are land, and the coolest
                areas (shown in white and blue) are mostly cloud. The
                sea-surface temperatures are shown using green (coolest) to 
                red (warmest). The range of temperatures shown in the image 
                is approximately 283 Kelvin to 315 Kelvin.</p>

<p>                Of particular interest in this image are the clouds formed
                by the turbulent flow of air across the Canaries. Note also 
                the significant increase in sea-surface temperature on the
                leeward sides of the islands.</p>

                The image was obtained from ATSR-2's nadir view, during a day-time

<p>
                Note the increased intensity of the signal from the sea-surface towards 
                the right-hand side of the image. This is caused by the reflection of 
                the Sun directly into the instrument view; the Sun is always towards the 
                East during day-time ERS-1 passes, since the satellite orbit is 
                sun-synchronous, and the local time at the southward Equator-crossing
                is approximately 10:30am.</p>
