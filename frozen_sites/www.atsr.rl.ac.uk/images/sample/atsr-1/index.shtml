Other more tenuous blue regions are cooler sea except for the extreme north-west corner of the image which is the Spanish coast. However the most striking feature of this image is the intricate pattern apparent in the Mediterranean Sea temperature. Eddy structures ranging in size from less than 10km to nearly 100km decorate the entire sea area. Note that the warmest water appears to originate from the Gulf de Bougie on the Algerian coast.<p>

Most of the land area is Senegal, although the Gambia, Guinea Bissau and Guinea are also represented. As this is a night-time image, the land at around 290K is several Kelvin cooler than the sea.

<p>This picture has been scaled to highlight the circular feature slightly north-west from the centre. Almost 40km in diameter, its appearance is suggestive of a meteorite impact crater, but confirmation of this theory would require a detailed analysis of the material in the `crater'. A further striking aspect of this image is the fractal appearance of much of the land surface and several coastal inlets. </p>

<p>The River Seine is the most prominent feature on the French landscape, but Paris is just beyond the lower extent of this image. The temperature gradients seen in the North Sea are characteristic of that region ranging from 290K in coastal waters to about 280K mid-channel. </p>

In this false-colour representation the coldest areas (clouds) are blue, with purple and yellow representing increasingly warmer temperatures. </p>
<p>In this night-time image, the large yellow area is the Atlantic Ocean with the cooler land appearing red. The average temperature of the fire pixels is about 300K, but this is not representative of the fire temperature as only a small fraction of the 1 square kilometre pixel is actually on fire. </p>
<p>With the current instrument, the maximum measurable temperature is only 320K. However ATSR-2 (due to be launched in 1995) will have the facility to measure temperatures above 500K. </p>

Most striking is the stable and regular pattern of crescent-shaped clouds (shown in white) which are shed alternately from the east and west sides of the northern-most island. Such a pattern is known as a Von Karman vortex street, and this particular manifestation is the subject of a detailed study at RAL. </p>

<P>On this image the mighty Amazon River is shown spilling into the Atlantic Ocean. 
  The simple colour scheme used shows clouds as white, the land as green and the

<P>The other images in this directory are single-wavelength views which have had 
  no atmospheric correction applied. However in the tropics the effect of the 
  Earth's atmosphere can depress the temperature as measured by a satellite-borne 
  instrument by as much as 10K. </P>
<P>This image is a result of processing data from three of ATSR's channels and 
  using both the instrument's views to make the appropriate atmospheric correction. 
</P>
<P>The large width of the Amazon enables an accurate determination of the river's 
  temperature to be made, (300K in this image). In the case of rivers narrower 
  than ATSR's 1km resolution, temperature measurements are inevitably an average 
  of both land and water temperature.</P>
