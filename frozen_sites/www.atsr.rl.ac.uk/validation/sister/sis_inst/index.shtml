<h2>The SISTeR Validation Radiometer</h2>
<p>The SISTeR (Scanning Infrared Sea Surface Temperature Radiometer) is a compact 
  and robust chopped self-calibrating filter radiometer. It measures approximately 
  20 × 20 × 40cm and weighs about 20kg. The instrument is divided into three compartments 
  containing the foreoptics, scan mirror and reference black bodies, and a small-format 
  PC with signal processing and control electronics. The SISTeR has been designed 
  to survive and maintain its calibration over extended periods in a maritime 
  environment. The foreoptics and electronics compartments are waterproof and 
  the scan mirror and black bodies are carefully protected with interleaved baffles.</p>

<p>The foreoptics compartment contains a DLATGS pyroelectric detector and preamplifier, 
  mounted onto assembly containing a concentric 6-position filter wheel and a 
  black rotating chopper. The filter wheel presently contains three narrow-band 
  filters centred at 3.7µm, 10.8µm and 12.0µm, matching those in the ATSR instruments. 
  The beam is chopped at 100Hz, a compromise between the optimum noise performance 
  of the detector and a fast filter response in the signal processing chain. The 
  main optical element is an ellipsoid mirror, by which the detector can view 
  a 45° scan mirror through a anti-reflection coated ZnSe window.</p>
<p>The scan mirror can direct the detector's view to either of two internal black 
  bodies or to the external scene at any point about an arc spanning 180° from 
  nadir to zenith. Two concentric baffles surround the scan mirror. A field plane 
  is centred in an exit aperture in the outer baffle, so that the aperture can 
  be made as small as possible and provide the maximum internal protection. The 
  full cone angle of the instrumental field of view is approximately 13°.</p>
<p>The self-calibrating design of SISTeR is intrinsically tolerant of contamination 
  to its optics. The entire optical system is referred to two highly accurate 
  reference black bodies. One floats near to ambient temperature and the other 
  at approximately 10K above ambient temperature. Embedded in each black body 
  is a 27<font face="Symbol">W</font>. RhFe thermometer. The entire black body 
  cavity can be installed in a specially-constructed calibration block maintained 
  by Oxford University, and the thermometer calibrated to an absolute accuracy 
  of better than 14mK relative to ITS90. As the ambient temperature on a boat 
  or ship is generally very near to the sea surface temperature, the cooler black 
  body temperature always tracks that of the sea.</p>

<h3>SISTeR Operation</h3>
<p>All aspects of the SISTeR instrument, from the scan mirror position to the 
  detector signal are accessible through variables defined in a C library. Control 
  programs of arbitrary complexity can be written, but generally just a few lines 
  of code are needed to define a scan sequence. When a control program is running, 
  the complete instrument state is transmitted over a serial link to a laptop 
  ground station after every measurement.</p>
<p>All SISTeR measurement sequences contain repeated measurements of its two internal 
  black bodies. In addition, to calculate the skin SST, the SISTeR is programmed 
  to make measurements both of upwelling radiances from the sea surface and complementary 
  downwelling sky radiances.</p>
<p>In the SISTeR longwave channels, the measured noise temperature for a 1 second 
  sample at typical SSTs is less than 30mK. Measurements of an external CASOTS 
  black body [1] before, during and after a typical one-month validation campaign 
  showed that the SISTeR calibration remained repeatable to better than 20mK, 
  even though the scan mirror finish had deteriorated noticeably over the same 
  period. The SISTeR has taken part in seven campaigns so far, in Mutsu Wan, the 
  English Channel and in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.</p>
<h3>Skin SST Measurements</h3>
<p>Typically, SISTeR radiances are sampled every 0.8s with the 10.8µm filter. 
  Skin SSTs are calculated from the upwelling ocean radiance samples, corrected 
  for a small reflected sky radiance term with the complementary sky samples. 
  Over a flat sea surface and for a narrow filter function, the upwelling radiance 
  can be approximated closely as</p>
<p align="center"> R_<i>up</i> = B(SST) + (1 - <font face="Symbol">e</font>) R_<i>down</i></p>
<p>where R_<i>up</i> and R_<i>down</i> are the upwelling sea and complimentary 
  downwelling sky radiances, <font face="Symbol">e</font> is the emissivity of the
  sea surface and B(T) is the Planck function, each integrated over the instrumental
  filter function and field of view. R_<i>up </i>and R_<i>down</i> are measured directly
  by the SISTeR,  and so the term B(SST) and hence the skin SST can be retrieved from
  these.</p>
<h3>SISTeR Mounting and Support</h3>
<p>The SISTeR is generally mounted as far forward and as high as possible on the 
  host ship, so that it is clear of "green water" and spray, and can view undisturbed 
  water forward of the bow wave. Where possible, the viewing angle to the sea 
  is kept within the range 15° - 40° from nadir [2]. The instrument also requires 
  a clear view to the sky at the complementary angle from zenith.</p>
<p>The SISTeR is equipped with a quick release mount and is provided with a small 
  turret, to which a mating bracket is attached. The turret should be mounted 
  on a horizontal surface with a pattern of eight holes (see diagrams, dimensions 
  in millimetres). A small horizontal platform, with the pattern pre-drilled, 
  is also available and can be attached to handrails with U-bolts (see photo).</p>
<p>The SISTeR requires 24V DC power and serial data connections. Instrument data 
  is logged remotely on a laptop PC. Waterproof power supplies, serial modems 
  and cable sets are available for runs of 100m or more with terminations for 
  a variety of mains outlets.</p>
