<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This folder contains data licences prepared by the Centre for Environmental Data Analysis (CEDA). The contents include 4 generic licences designed to aid wider re-used of these licences (as described below) and specific data licences. Not all licences here are in present use.</p>


<h2>Generic Licences</h2>
<p>4 generic licences have been produced by CEDA to address common licence requirements. These have been based on the UK Open Government Licence (OGL) and UK Non-Commercial Open Government Licences, which are equivalent to CC-by and CC-by-nc. Each of these 4 generic licences has a symlink below which points to the latest version of the licence. All versions of the licence are available under the associated "_versions" sub-folder to aid access to previous versions of the licence or linking to specific versions.</p>
