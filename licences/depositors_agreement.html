  Conditions for Data Deposit in a NERC data centre.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The depositor confirms that they are the owner of the data and/or has the right to deposit
    the data in a NERC archive.
  </li>
  <li>
    Your ownership of the data remains unchanged when deposited in the archive. However, NERC
    reserves the right to store the data, and make the data available under an appropriate licence.
  </li>
  <li>
    The depositor is also giving NERC permission to translate the data to any medium or format for
    the purpose of future preservation and accessibility. Any preservation actions taken will try
    not to change the meaning of the data significantly.
  </li>
  <li>
    The description of the data provided for catalogue records will be made freely available for
    any purpose.  This may be harvested by other cataloging and indexing services.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the dataset needs to be withdrawn, for any reason, a tombstone catalogue record will be kept
    in its place. Any request for withdrawal of a dataset will need to be justified before it is
    taken down.
  </li>
  <li>
    Any personal information such as data creator email addresses should only be included where
    appropriate to enable traceability of the data.
  </li>
