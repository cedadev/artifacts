     FORMAT OF HEADER RECORD ('FIELD DESCRIPTOR' OR 'FDR') FOR PP-FIELDS
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Listed below are details of the format of the m4-word header required
for any field in 'PP-format'.  (Before release 5 of the package a
42-word header was used - see member @HRD42 for details of format.)
For fields on a disk or tape dataset, this header must be a SEPARATE
RECORD preceding the field itself.  It is also sometimes referred to as
the "field descriptor record" or FDR.  (See @FIELD for a description of
the data record, containing the field values).  In PP-package programs,
fields are read in to blank common with the header immediately preceding
the field data.

  Any header variables which are not applicable to the field (except
BMDI) should be specified as zero.

  Unified model documentation paper F3 section 4 also documents
header records.

  In the list below, each word is numbered and followed by a variable
name.  These names are names of ARRAYS in blank common which can be used
with the 'NPBGN' array in the common block COMPNT if it is necessary to
refer to particular header words for a particular field.  For example,
the hour of the validity time of the Kth field in blank common can be
found in LBHR(NPBGN(K)).  Both '*CALL BLANK' and '*CALL COMPNT' must
appear in the program to do this.

   1  LBYR      Year  (eg 1986 or 86) \
   2  LBMON     Month          (1-12)  |   Validity time of field,
   3  LBDAT     Day of month   (1-31)  |              - or -
   4  LBHR      Hour           (0-23)  |   Start of averaging period (for time
   5  LBMIN     Minute         (0-59)  |   mean fields).
   6  LBDAY     Day number of run     /

   7  LBYRD     Year  (eg 1986 or 86) \
   8  LBMOND    Month          (1-12)  |   Data time (for forecast fields),
   9  LBDATD    Day of month   (1-31)  |              - or -
  10  LBHRD     Hour           (0-23)  |   End of averaging period (for time
  11  LBMIND    Minute         (0-59)  |   mean fields).
  12  LBDAYD    Day number of run     /

  13  LBTIM     Time indicator.  This indicates what the times in words 1-12
                represent.  Referring to the times represented by words 1-6 and
                7-12 as 'T1' and 'T2' respectively, LBTIM is coded as
                (100*IA + 10*IB + IC) where:

                  IA = 0  except for time mean fields in which case IA
                          is the time interval in hours between the
                          individual fields from which the mean was
                          computed (IA may be left as zero for
                          time-means to indicate that the time interval
                          is unspecified).

                  IB = 0  if only the validity time (T1) is valid.
                     = 1  if the field is a forecast from T2 valid at T1.
                     = 2  if the field is a time mean between T1 and T2,
                          or represents a sequence of times between T1
                          and T2.
                     = 3  if the field is a time mean from T1 to T2 for
                          each year from LBYR to LBYRD.
                     = 4  if the field is a difference between fields
                          valid at T1 and T2 (in sense T2-T1).
                     = 5  if the field is a mean daily cycle between
                          T2 and T1

                  IC = 0  if 'model time' is used for T1 and T2 (i.e. only day
                          number, hour and minute are set).
                     = 1  if the 'real' (i.e. Gregorian) calendar is used for T1
                          and T2.
                     = 2  if the '360-day' year calendar (i.e. 12 30-day months)
                          is used for T1 and T2.  (This is used in Met.O.20 for
                          some model runs.)
                     = 3  if 'model time' is used for T1 and T2 (i.e. only day
                          number, hour and minute are valid; year, month and
                          day in month are to be ignored if set).

                'IC' corresponds to the parameter MCAL in COMCON.
                If 'IC' is 1 or 2, coding of the 'day numbers' (words 6 and 12)
                is optional: code as 0 if not used.

  14  LBFT      Forecast period (hours).

  15  LBLREC    Length of data record in words (including any 'extra data').

  16  LBCODE    Grid code.  This indicates the type of grid and is coded as:

                   1  Regular latitude/longitude grid.
                   2  Regular lat/long grid boxes (grid points are box centres).
                   3  Polar stereographic grid.
                   4  Spectral coefficients.
                   7  Mercator grid.
                   8  Plane polar grid.
                   9  Plane Cartesian grid.

                For grids with non-standard polar axis, add 100 to the above
                numbers.

                For cross sections, code as (10000 + 100*IX + IY) where IX and
                IY are codes for the x- and y-axes from the list below. Cross
                section fields indicated in this way must contain x- and y-
                coordinate vectors in the extra data. The following was not
                implemented on the IBM version.  When LBCODE is coded as 30000 +
                100*IX + IY, with IX and IY from the same list, the axes are
                given the same interpretation as for a normal cross section, but
                coordinate vectors need not be supplied. In this case, however,
                the field is not regarded as a cross section by PP cross-section
                routines.

                Axis codes are as follows:

                     0  Sigma (or eta, for hybrid coordinate data).
                     1  Pressure (mb).
                     2  Height above sea level (km).
                     3  Eta (U.M. hybrid coordinates) only.
                     4  Depth below sea level (m).
                     5  Model level.
                     6  Theta.
                     7  Sigma only.
                     8  Sigma-theta.
                    10  Latitude (degrees N).
                    11  Longitude (degrees E).
                    12  (Horizontal) distance (km).
                    13  Site number (set of parellel rows or columns eg
                        timeseries)
                    20  Time (days). (Gregorian calendar (not 360 day year)
                                      if distinction applicable )
                    21  Time (months).
                    22  Time (years).
                    23  Time (model days with 360 day model calendar)
                    31  Logarithm to base 10 of pressure in mb.
                    40  Pseudolevel
                    99  Other.

  17  LBHEM     Hemisphere indicator.  For geographical grids (lat/long, polar
                stereographic, Mercator or 'Kurihara' grids), this is coded as:

                  0  Global field (i.e. covering the WHOLE globe).
                  1  Northern hemisphere polar stereographic grid, or other
                     geographic grid covering the WHOLE northern hemisphere.
                  2  Southern hemisphere polar stereographic grid, or other
                     geographic grid covering the WHOLE southern hemisphere.
                  3  Limited area of globe without 'wrap-around' (i.e. NOT
                     covering the full 360-degree longitude range).
                  4  Limited area of globe with 'wrap-around' (i.e. covering the
                     full 360-degree longitude range).

                For SPECTRAL COEFFICIENTS, code 0, 1 or 2 as appropriate.
                For CROSS-SECTION FIELDS, a value of 3 should be coded.
                For GRAPH FIELDS, a value of 5 should be coded.
                For LATERAL BOUNDARY DATA a value of 99 should be coded.

  18  LBROW     Number of rows in field.
                (For spectral coefficients, code the 'n' truncation level.)

  19  LBNPT     Number of grid points in each row.
                (For staggered grids, code values appropriate for the longest
                row. For spectral coefficients, code the 'm' truncation level.)

  23  LBFC      Field code. This indicates what the data in the field represents
                A table of field codes is given in PPP.DOC.TEXT(@FCODES).
                Some of the more common field codes are listed below.

                  1  Height field                73  Relative vorticity field
                  8  Pressure field              74  Divergence field
                 16  Temperature field           88  Relative humidity field

  24  LBCFC     Second field code.  This is only used for a field which is a
                combination of two field types; for example, a meridional
                temperature flux field (a product of V and T).  Coding is as for
                the field code above.

  25  LBPROC    Processing code.  This indicates what processing has been done
                to the basic field.  It should be 0 if no processing has been
                done:  otherwise add together the relevant numbers from the list
                below:

                      1   Difference from another experiment.
                      2   Difference from zonal (or other spatial) mean.

                (For details of BLEV and BRLEV, see words 32 and 33.)

  26  LBVC      Vertical co-ordinate type.  The 'vertical co-ordinate' is the
                one which has the same value at every grid point; e.g.
                'pressure' for a 500mb height field or 'longitude' for a zonal
                mean cross section. The co-ordinate type is coded using the
                table of field codes as for word 23. Numbers 126-139 are used
                for special levels.  The most common vertical co-ordinate types
                are:

                    1  Height (m)              8  Pressure (mb)
                    9  Hybrid co-ordinates    10  Sigma (=p/p*)
                    65  Hybrid height co-ordinates

                    143  Lower hybrid level  176  Latitude (deg)
                    177  Longitude (deg)

                For a fuller list, see  PPP.DOC.TEXT(@FCODES) .

  27  LBRVC     Vertical co-ordinate type for reference level.  Used only when a
                reference level is applicable as in thickness fields or layer
                mean fields. Coded as above.
                Set to 0 by the U.M. if no reference level.

34-37 LBRSVD(4)  Reserved for future PP-package use.

  38  LBSRCE    In Met Office Unified Model, set to 1111 to indicate
                items 39-43 are in use as below.  Otherwise, spare for
                user's use.

  39-45         In the PP package in general, these words are available for
                the user's own purposes, and can be accessed as the integer
                array LBUSER or the real array BUSER. In the Met Office
                Unified Model, they are regarded as integer and have the
                purposes described below. NB Before version 4.1, there was
                an inconsistency in the treatment of the datatype of LBUSER(7)
                in FIELDCOS.

  39  LBUSER(1) In Met. Office Unified Model: Indicator for datatype, currently
                1 (REAL data) for all output fields; fields of INTEGER/LOGICAL
                type will not be available until further development work on
                the diagnostic system is undertaken, as FIELDCOS does not
                handle them.

  46  BRSVD(1)  Vertical coordinate of the higher boundary of layer
                ("higher" being in the direction of increasing model
                level number). For hybrid coordinates, code the
                'B'-value of the level.  This word is referred to as
                BULEV in the Unified Model.

  47  BRSVD(2)  'A'-value of the vertical coordinate of the higher
                boundary of the layer. This word is referred to as
                BHULEV in the Unified Model.

  48  BRSVD(3)  Reserved for future PP-package use.

  49  BRSVD(4)  Reserved for future PP-package use.

  50  BDATUM    Constant value subtracted from each value in field.  This is
                usually zero but would be 273.15 for a temperature field in
                degrees Celsius.

  51  BACC      (Packed fields only)  Packing accuracy.

  52  BLEV      Level.  This is the value of the vertical co-ordinate LBVC (word
                26) appropriate for the field; e.g. '500.0' for a 500 mb height
                field.  For hybrid levels code the 'B'-value of the level.  BLEV
                should be zero if the vertical co-ordinate type is in the range
                128 to 139.

  53  BRLEV     EITHER

                Reference level.  This is the value of the vertical co-ordinate
                LBRVC (word 27) appropriate for the field.  It is used when a
                second level is relevant as for example with thickness fields
                when the 'reference level' should be the one nearest the
                ground. Code as for BLEV.

                OR

                Vertical coordinate of the lower boundary of layer ("lower"
                being in the direction of decreasing model level number). For
                hybrid coordinates, code the 'B'-value of the level.

  54  BHLEV     (Hybrid levels) 'A'-value of level.

  55  BHRLEV    (Hybrid levels) 'A'-value of the reference level or the
                lower boundary of the layer.

  56  BPLAT     Real latitude of 'pseudo' N pole of projection.  Code as '90.0'
                for fields on grid with normal polar axis.
  57  BPLON     Real longitude of 'pseudo' N pole of projection.  Code as '0.0'
                for fields on grid with normal polar axis.

  58  BGOR   \
  59  BZY     |  These five parameters define the grid for the field.
  60  BDY     |  The coding depends on what type of grid the field is on.
  61  BZX     |  Details for various types follow:
  62  BDX    /
                (i) Latitude/longitude grids.
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                BGOR   Not used - set to zero.
                BZY    Latitude of 'zeroth' row (i.e. an imaginary row one grid
                       length before the first row) in degrees (north positive).
                BDY    Latitude interval between rows in degrees (negative if
                       rows are north to south).
                BZX    Longitude of 'zeroth' point in row (i.e. an imaginary
                       point one grid length before the first point) in degrees
                       (east positive).
                BDX    Longitude spacing of points in each row in degrees
                       (negative if points run from east to west).

                (ii) Polar stereographic grids.
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                BGOR   Grid orientation. This is the longitude in degrees of the
                       meridian which would be vertical with north at the top on
                       a chart drawn for the grid.
                BZY    Reference latitude in degrees (see BDY).
                BDY    Grid length in metres at reference latitude.
                                      \   These co-ordinates are in grid lengths
                BZX    'X' co-ordinate |  (not necessarily whole numbers and not
                       of the pole.    |  necessarily representing a point
                BDX    'Y' co-ordinate |  within the area covered by the grid)
                       of the pole.    |  counting the bottom left grid point of
                                      /   a chart as the point (1.0, 1.0).
                (iii) Mercator grids.
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   For Mercator grids, the coding is the
                same as in (i) except that BZY and BDY are values of:

                    (earth's radius) * log((1+sin(latitude))/cos(latitude))

                instead of latitude. (The earth's radius is in metres and 'log'
                refers to the natural logarithm.)

                (iv) Cross sections.
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   For cross-section grids, coding is as in
                (i) above except that BZY and BDY are values of the 'y'
                co-ordinate and BZX and BDX are values of the 'x' co-ordinate.
                (Note that for zonal mean fields or cross sections along a
                meridian, BZX and BZY are longitudes.)  If the cross section is
                on irregularly spaced levels, BZY and BDY should both be zero.

                (v) Graph fields.
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   For graph fields, coding is as in (i) above
                except that BZX and BDX are values of the 'x' co-ordinate, and
                BDY and BZY are both coded as 1.0. If points on the graphs are
                not evenly spaced in the 'x' co-ordinate, BZX and BDX should
                both be coded as zero.

                (vi) Spectral coefficients.
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                BGOR   Not used - coded as zero.
                BZY    Not used - coded as zero.
                BDY    Not used - coded as zero.
                BZX    Reference longitude - usually 0.0.  This is the meridian
                       which is treated as the origin of longitude for the
                       coefficients.
                BDX    Not used - coded as zero.

  63  BMDI      Value used in the field to indicate missing data points.  If the
                field contains no missing data, code a value of -1.0E30.

  64  BMKS      MKS scaling factor, equal to the size of the unit in which the
                field is expressed divided by the corresponding mks unit.  (e.g.
                10.0 for height in dam,  100.0 for pressure in mb,  0.01 for
                relative humidity in % etc.).
