comments,28,1. The middle portion of this code table (code figures 100-199) includes terms on several levels to cover simple and increasingly complex automatic stations. 
comments,28,"2. Generic terms for weather (e.g. fog, drizzle) are intended for use at automatic stations capable of determining types of weather but no other information. Generic terms are included in the code table using all capital letters. "
comments,28,"3. Code figures for generic precipitation (code figures 140-148) are arranged in order of increasing complexity. For example, a very simple station that can sense only the presence or absence of precipitation would use code figure 140 (precipitation). At the next level, an automatic station capable of sensing amount but not type would use code figure 141 or 142. An automatic station capable of sensing gross type (liquid, solid, freezing) and amount would use code figures 143-148. An automatic station capable of reporting actual types of precipitation (e.g. drizzle rain), but not the amount, would use the appropriate whole decile number (e.g. 150 for generic drizzle, 160 for generic rain).
