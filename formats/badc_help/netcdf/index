<H2>What is netCDF?</H2>
</a>

<P>
NetCDF (network Common Data Form) is an interface for array-orientated 
data access and a library that provides an implementation of that
interface. Many groups have adopted netCDF as a standard way to
represent their scientific data. The netCDF software was developed
at the Unidata Program Center in Boulder Colorado USA.

<UL>
<P>
  <LI>NetCDF is used extensively in the atmospheric and oceanic
  science communities.</LI>
  <LI>NetCDF is a portable self-describing binary data format.</LI>
  <LI>NetCDF is network-transparent, meaning that it can be accessed by computers 
  that store integers, characters and floating-point numbers in different ways.</LI>
  <LI>NetCDF provides direct-access: a small subset of a large dataset may be 
  accessed efficiently, without first reading through all the preceding data.</LI>
  <LI>NetCDF is appendable: data can be appended to a netCDF dataset along one 
  dimension without copying the dataset or redefining its structure.</LI>
  <LI>NetCDF datasets can be read and written in a number of languages,
  these include C, C++, FORTRAN, IDL, Python, Perl, and Java.</LI>
  <LI>The different language implementations 
  are <A HREF="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/copyright.html"
  TARGET="_top">freely</A> available 
  from <A HREF="ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/netcdf/">the UNIDATA ftp area</A>
  or from 
  other <A HREF="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/mirrors.html">mirror
  sites</A>.</LI>
  <LI>Several graphics packages support netCDF input, making it
  very easy to display and analyse netCDF datasets. For instance
  <A HREF="http://ferret.wrc.noaa.gov/Ferret/" TARGET="_top">FERRET</A> and
 <A HREF="http://esg.llnl.gov/cdat/">CDAT</A>
  provide both command line and graphical user interfaces for
  displaying and analysing gridded data.</LI>
  <LI>NetCDF is completely and methodically documented in UNIDATA's
  <A HREF="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/guide.txn_toc.html">NetCDF
  User's Guide</A>.</LI>
  <LI>Several groups have 
  defined <A HREF="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/conventions.html"
  TARGET="_top">conventions</A> for netCDF files, to enable the
  exchange of data. BADC has adopted the
  <A HREF="/help/formats/netcdf/index_cf.html">Climate and Forecasting (CF) conventions</A> for
  netCDF data. </LI>

<H2>NetCDF and CF conventions</H2>
</a>

<p>
The BADC supports and strongly recommends the compliance with the
<a href="http://www.cfconventions.org/">Climate
and Forecast (CF) Metadata Convention</a>.
</p>

<P>
CF conventions are guidelines and recommendations as to where to put information
within a netCDF file, and they provide advice as to what type of information you 
might want to include.
CF conventions allow the creator of the dataset to include information
about the data and the dataset itself (metadata) in a structured way, which makes
it easier for other users to retrieve the information.
<i>Global attributes</i> 
describe the general properties and origins of the dataset
while <i>local attributes</i> are used to characterise the recorded variables.
<p>

</p>
The BADC provides <a href="index_cf.html">Information on the CF Convention</a>,
illustrated by some examples.
</P>

<a name="Example">
<H2>What's in a netCDF file?</H2>
</a>

<P>
We have available <A HREF="nc_example.html">a very simple example</A> of a
netCDF file with CF conventions applied. A netCDF dataset (the filename 
ends in <strong>.nc</strong>) is made up of three basic components:
</P>
<UL>
<P>
  <LI>variables</LI>
  <LI>dimensions</LI>
  <LI>attributes</LI>
</P>
</UL>

<P>
The variables store the actual data, the dimensions give the
relevant dimension information for the variables, and the attributes
provide auxiliary information about the variables or the dataset
itself. You can study <A HREF="nc_example.html">an example of a netCDF file</A>
and see more details of the components in a netCDF dataset. The 
global attributes can also be added to the netCDF file, following
<A HREF="index_cf.html">CF conventions</A>. 
</P>


<a name="Reading">
<H2>Reading and writing netCDF</H2>
</a>

<P>
The popularity of netCDF stems from its portability and relative
ease of use. Although it is a binary data format the netCDF distribution
comes complete with the <strong>ncdump</strong> utility which produces
an ASCII dump of the dataset and thereby provides a quick-look
facility. You can also generate netCDF files from ASCII data files using the 
<strong>ncgen</strong> utility. 
</P>

<P>
The datasets are commonly written and read using library routines.
The library routines are sensibly named and relatively consistently
named across the different language implementations.
</P>
