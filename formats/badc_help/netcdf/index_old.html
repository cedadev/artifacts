<P><EM>This is intended as a short introduction to netCDF data.

<H3>Why use netCDF?</H3>

<UL>
  <LI>NetCDF is used extensively in the atmospheric and oceanic
  science communities.
  <LI>NetCDF is a portable self-describing binary data format.
  <LI>NetCDF is network-transparent, meaning that it can be accessed by computers 
that store integers, characters and floating-point numbers in different ways.
  <LI>NetCDF provides direct-access: a small subset of a large dataset may be 
accessed efficiently, without first reading through all the preceding data.
  <LI>NetCDF is appendable: data can be appended to a NetCDF dataset along one 
dimension without copying the dataset or redefining its structure.
  <LI>NetCDF datasets can be read and written in a number of languages,
  these include C, C++, FORTRAN, idl, Python, Perl, and Java.
  <LI>The different language implementations are <A HREF="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/copyright.html"
  TARGET="_top">freely</A> available from <A HREF="ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/netcdf/">UNIDATA</A>
  or from other <A HREF="./" http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/mirrors.html">mirror
  sites</A>.
  <LI>Several graphics packages support netCDF input, making it
  very easy to display and analyse netCDF datasets. For instance
  <A HREF="http://ferret.wrc.noaa.gov/Ferret/" TARGET="_top">FERRET</A>
  provides both command line and graphical user interfaces for
  displaying and analysing gridded data.
<li>NetCDF is completely and methodically documented in UNIDATA's
<a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/guide.txn_toc.html">NetCDF
User's Guide</a>
  <LI>Several groups have defined <A HREF="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/conventions.html"
  TARGET="_top">conventions</A> for netCDF files, to enable the
  exchange of data.
</UL>

<H3>Reading and writing NetCDF</H3>

<P>The popularity of netCDF stems from its portability and relative
ease of use. Although it is a binary data format the netCDF distribution
comes complete with the <B>ncdump</B> utility which produces
an ascii dump of the dataset and thereby provides a quick-look
facility. You can also generate NetCDF files from ASCII data files using the 
<B>ncgen</B> utility. 

<P>The datasets are commonly written and read using library routines.
The library routines are sensibly named and relatively consistently
named across the different language implementations.

<H3>What's in a NetCDF file</H3>

<P>A netCDF dataset is made up of three basic components:

<UL>
  <LI>attributes
  <LI>dimensions
  <LI>variables.
</UL>

<P>The variables store the actual data, the dimensions give the
relevant dimension information for the variables, and the attributes
provide auxiliary information about the variables or the dataset
itself. For instance a dataset containing three dimensionally
gridded temperature data would have a variable for temperature,
with three dimensions, longitude, latitude and level. The attributes
might contain information such as the units of temperature. This
is obviously a simple example; in principle there is no limit
to the number of variables, or dimensions in a NetCDF dataset.
