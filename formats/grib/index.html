<I>A brief introduction to the GRIB data format.</I>
<HR ALIGN=LEFT>

<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>This page gives a brief introduction to GRIB (GRIdded Binary) data with particular
emphasis on the GRIB files held at the BADC. The aim is to give
an indication of what to expect when faced with a GRIB file. More
detailed documentation is available, for example at 
<A HREF="http://dss.ucar.edu/docs/formats/grib/gribdoc">NCAR</A> 
and the <A HREF="http://www-imk.fzk.de:8080/imk2/kasima/aktuelles/grib/">IMK</A>.
<P>GRIB is a WMO (World Meteorological Organisation) standard format for archiving and exchanging gridded
data. GRIB is a binary format, and the data is packed to increase storage efficiency. GRIB data is also self-describing,
meaning that the information needed to read the file is present within the file.
This page outlines how the data and information needed to interpret
the data is stored in a GRIB file.

<H3>GRIB Structure</H3>

<P>Each GRIB file is composed of a series of <b>GRIB records</b>. One
GRIB record holds the gridded data for one parameter at one time
and at one level. Each GRIB record is composed of <b>6 GRIB sections</b>.
Section 4 contains the data itself. The other sections give the
information required to read the GRIB record, and information
on the meteorological parameter contained in the record, the level
the record refers to and the type of grid the parameter is on. The 
sections are as follows:

<P>
<B>Section 0:</B> Indicator Section.<BR>
<B>Section 1:</B> Product Definition Section.<BR>
<B>Section 2:</B> Grid Description Section - Optional.<BR>
<B>Section 3:</B> Bit Map Section - Optional.<BR>
<B>Section 4:</B> Binary Data Section.<BR>
<B>Section 5:</B> '7777' - ASCII Characters indicating end of GRID record.<P>

Section 1, known as the Product Definition Section (PDS), and section
2, known as the Grid Definition Section (GDS), are the information sections
most frequently referred to by users of GRIB data. The PDS 
(section 1) contains information about the
parameter, level type, level and date of the record. The GDS 
(section 2) contains information on the grid type (such as 
whether the grid is regular or gaussian), and the resolution of
the grid. 

<H3>GRIB codes</H3>

<P>Some of the information in the GRIB record information sections
are represented by integer codes. For instance, the name of the
parameter in the GRIB record is indicated using an integer known
as the GRIB parameter code, or parameter identifier. Code tables,
which are not part of the GRIB file but are held separately for each 
dataset using data in GRIB format.

<H3>Reading GRIB</H3>

<P>Being coded binary files, GRIB files are not readable 
without the use of suitable software. 
There are utilities held at the BADC which can be used to decode GRIB files. An example 
is the <a href="/help/software/xconv/">XCONV/CONVSH</a> package that can be obtained from the BADC.

<p>The <a href="http://www.ncl.ucar.edu/">NCAR Command Language</a> readily reads all GRIB-1 and GRIB-2 files.

<P>Other freely available software packages that can read GRIB via the 
<a href="/help/software/grads/grads-grib.html">GrADS/GRIB</a> interface 
are:
<ul>
<li><a href="/help/software/cdat/">CDAT (Climate Data Analysis Tools)</a> 
<li><a href="/help/software/grads/">GrADS (Grid Analysis and Display  System)</a>.
</ul>
<P>On the BADC computer, <I>login.badc.rl.ac.uk</I>, you can list the 
information sections of the GRIB records in the file use by using the
<KBD>grib2brief</KBD> utility (by typing "grib2brief filename" at
 the command line prompt). This utility prints out the
Product Definition Section, Grid Definition Section, and first
20 data values of each GRIB record in the GRIB file. (<KBD>grib2brief</KBD>
also outputs a third information section, the Bit Map Section, which is usually 
absent on files held at the BADC). 

<P>If you would prefer to write your own routines for reading GRIB data, a complete 
description of the format is given in the <a href="gribdoc.txt">Guide to GRIB</a>.

<H3>Example</H3>
Using
<KBD>grib2brief</KBD> on one of the ECMWF 2.5&deg; gridded data files held at the BADC
will produce an output similar to that displayed below. The <EM>[emphasised]</EM>
text at the line ends has been added here to highlight the most
useful pieces of information in the GRIB information sections.
It is worth noting that in the Grid definition section latitudes
and longitudes are given in millidegrees.

</KBD>Decoding Software</H3>

<P>The BADC has several GRIB decoding <A HREF="/data/ecmwf-era/software.html">
utilities</A>. One which is particularly popular as it will run on
a wide range of platforms is <a href="/help/software/xconv">XCONV</a>
 (and its command line counterpart CONVSH). Other freely available software packages that can read GRIB via the 
<a href="/help/software/grads/grads-grib.html">GrADS/GRIB</a> interface 
are <a href="/help/software/cdat/">CDAT (Climate Data Analysis Tools)</a> 
and <a href="/help/software/grads/">GrADS (Grid Analysis and Display  System)</a>.

<P>The ECMWF provides it own Fortran library for decoding GRIB data for free on 
the <A HREF="http://www.ecmwf.int/products/data/software/grib.html">ECMWF Software
pages</A>. Documentation is also provided for the latest versions.

<P>Another commonly used GRIB decoder, that also runs on PCs, is 
<A HREF="http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/wesley/wgrib.html">wgrib</A>.
A copy of wgrib and related documentation is available for users of ECMWF 
data held at the BADC (in the 
<A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/ecmwf-era/software/decoder/wgrib?action=login">
software</A> directory - registered users only).
