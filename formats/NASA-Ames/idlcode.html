<P>
<em>Please note that the BADC is providing this code 'as is' and we cannot guarantee that either the documentation or the comments in the code are correct. A BADC user has however pointed out that there is a discrepancy between the documentation and the IDL code comments regarding the date of mission format. In this case, the IDL code seems to have incorrect comments.</em>
