<h3>Verify NASA-Ames file format</h3>

<a href="/cgi-bin/dataex_file.cgi.pl">Run NASA-Ames format checking program</a>
<p>
This program can be used to check your NASA-Ames files for correctness. When you
submit a file to the BADC it will be verified using this program and will be
rejected if it fails. 
<p>
<a href="help.html">Help on formatting problems</a> gives help on
common formatting problems and how to interpret the output from the format
checking program.
<p>
The NASA-Ames format specification listed below is also very helpful for 
understanding the error messages produced by the format checking program.

<h3>Submit NASA-Ames files to the BADC</h3>
<p>
The following links allow you to submit NASA-Ames files to the BADC. This is 
the preferred method of submitting files to us, rather than using FTP. 
It will verify your file before submission and will reject any file which fails
the verification.
<p>
In order to upload files you must have an account name and password with the
BADC. This is the same account name and password that you would use to FTP
files.
