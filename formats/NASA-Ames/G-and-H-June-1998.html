<H2>Preface to Version 1.3</H2></CENTER>
<P>The file format standards defined in Version 1.3 are the same as those in 
previous versions. The main change in this version is the elimination of the 
Section on file naming conventions, and the renumbering of the remaining 
Sections and pages. The file formats are independent of any particular file 
naming scheme, so the description of the file naming convention has been moved 
to a separate document. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<CENTER>
<H2>Preface to Version 1.2</H2></CENTER>
<P>The file format standards defined in Version 1.2 are the same as those in the 
two previous versions. The major changes in this version are to emphasize the 
requirement that independent variables be monotonic, and to slightly change the 
notation for several parameters to show their dependence on the unbounded 
independent variable. In previous versions those dependencies have been implied, 
and shown by examples, but not clearly stated. </P>
<P>Other minor changes have been made throughout the text to help clarify the 
concepts and requirements of the format standards, and variable definitions in 
some of the examples have been condensed. We appreciate the feedback we have 
received from users of the exchange files, and have used it as a guide for 
clarifying the standards. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<CENTER>
<H2>Preface</H2></CENTER>
<P>This document specifies format standards to be used to facilitate data 
exchange for aircraft missions managed by the Earth Science Division at NASA 
Ames Research Center. It is intended as a reference document for creating 
experimental datasets. The standards should be adhered to in all exchange files 
being contributed to the project archive, including instrumental measurements, 
theoretical calculations and operational data. It is important that the person 
responsible for actually generating a given dataset refer to this document when 
determining the format for that dataset. It is the responsibility of the 
principal investigator or team leader to make sure that the appropriate people 
have access to this document and that their data conform to the format 
standards. </P>
<P>The specifications described in this document grew out of an effort beginning 
with the 1987 Stratosphere Troposphere Exchange Project (STEP) to put the 
experimental aircraft data on a medium and in a format that would be accessible 
to all experiment participants during the field experiment. Flight planning 
could then take into account the data from a previous flight, increasing the 
likelihood of meeting the overall goals and objectives of a given campaign. The 
standards developed for STEP were also used in the 1987 Airborne Antarctic Ozone 
Experiment (AAOE) and the 1989 Airborne Arctic Stratospheric Expedition (AASE). 
The basic premise in specifying format standards was to create self-descriptive 
datasets using a prescribed header structure to contain information about the 
data in a given file. </P>
<P>The STEP experiment used only the ER-2 aircraft and consisted primarily of in 
situ, time series data. It was this single dimensional data for which the 
original format specification was written. The use of remote sensing instruments 
on both the DC-8 and ER-2, and the generation of model output files creates 
multi-dimensional data which do not fit well into that original format. To 
better account for the variety of data, we have formalized some of the original 
concepts and have extended the requirements for header information to more 
adequately characterize the data. The file header now must include explicit 
specification of data dimensionality. We have also allowed for a more flexible 
specification of the data structure by the use of a file format index, described 
in the text. </P>
<P>In writing this new format specification, a conscious effort was made to 
retain much of the progress made in past experiments towards creating an 
environment of free data exchange. We have tried to build a logical extension to 
the original concepts rather than making a radical departure from them. Those 
with experience in the previous experiments (STEP, AAOE and AASE) should 
recognize that, in many cases, the format for their exchange files will remain 
much the same under these new specifications with only relatively minor, but 
important, changes to the header entries. </P>
<P>We want to acknowledge the fact that this document is the product of 
interactions between the authors and the experiment participants; indeed, the 
idea of data exchange standards was originally driven by a consensus of the 
participants, not by the "data managers". We appreciate the feedback that we 
have received, both written and oral, and have incorporated many of the 
suggestions into the final document. We also want to encourage everyone to feel 
free to contact us if they have any questions, problems or suggestions. </P>

<H2>Introduction</H2></CENTER>
<P>This document describes a conceptual framework for specifying exchange data 
formats, and then gives a detailed description of the standard formats (although 
there are very important distinctions between measured quantities and those 
resulting from mathematical model calculations, for simplicity, the two will 
often be loosely termed "data"). Those considering writing exchange files must 
review the format options presented in this document and determine the format 
most suitable for recording their data. If none are deemed suitable, consult 
with the project archive manager to define a new format option. New file formats 
will be circulated to project participants as addenda to this document. </P>
<P>The primary goal of instituting format standards for data exchange is to 
promote accessibility and ease of use of a variety of datasets from different 
instruments, platforms and numerical models. The specific goals of the proposed 
system are: 
<UL>
  <LI>The exchange files must be readable on all computer systems commonly in 
  use. These include PC's (MS DOS), Apple Macs, DEC VMS and Unix 
systems.<BR><BR>
  <LI>The exchange files must be self describing, such that the information 
  needed to read the data is contained in an order dependent file header, and 
  the minimum information required to analyze the particular dataset is 
  contained within the file.<BR><BR>
  <LI>Maintain as much compatibility as possible with existing formats from 
  previous experiments, while allowing flexibility to handle new datasets and 
  formats.<BR><BR>
  <LI>Minimize the amount of software required to access diverse datasets by 
  categorizing the datasets and allowing a minimal number of data 
  formats.<BR><BR></LI></UL>
<P></P>
<P>The complexity of any system of standards increases with increasing 
generality. This standard represents a compromise between simplicity and 
generality. The generality of the proposed system stems from the incorporation 
of a file format index which, by referencing pre-defined format options, defines 
the format of both the file header and the data records. Thus, new file formats 
can be incorporated at a future time without changing those defined in this 
document. The complexity of this system increases with the number of file 
formats, so an attempt has been made to minimize the number of format options 
while at the same time accommodate the existing standard data formats from 
previous experiments; the file header formats are, however, different from the 
older standards. </P>
<P>An additional advantage of standardized file formats is that the data files 
can more easily be checked for format errors. Plans for future field experiments 
include computer programs to check the format of each data file as part of the 
procedure for submittal to the data archive. </P>
<P>The system described here assumes that all exchange files are in ASCII, 
because ASCII coded files are the most universally readable across computer 
systems from different vendors. It is anticipated that the same standards can be 
extended to include binary files as well. However, before that can be done, a 
convention for external data representation must be agreed upon due to the 
differences in internal representation on different machines. A special naming 
convention for binary files would also have to be adopted. </P>
<P>Section 2 describes the basic structure of the data files, the types of 
variables, and how they regulate the format specifications. Section 3 describes 
some precautionary measures to ensure readable files. The array and implied loop 
notation used to specify the formats are defined in Section 4, and a collection 
of definitions of the variables and terminology is contained in Section 5. The 
file format specifications are given in Section 6, with a summary of data record 
formats at the end of the Section. An example of each standard format is given 
in Section 7. Since any particular format option can accommodate a variety of 
types of data, the concepts, terminology, and format specifications are first 
presented in an abstract manner so not to bias or narrow their definition. The 
examples in Section 7 are included to provide a tangible link between the 
abstract definitions and actual exchange data files. It will, therefore, be 
useful to refer to these examples while (or before) reading the rest of this 
document. </P>

<H2>2</H2></CENTER>
<CENTER>
<H2>Concepts and Structures</H2></CENTER>
<P>The reason for writing an exchange file is to convey some measured, 
calculated, or otherwise derived quantity, which will be called the PRIMARY 
variable. There may be more than one PRIMARY variable in a given exchange file. 
In addition, there may be some ancillary information concerning the measurement, 
calculation, or interpretation of the PRIMARY variables or the data records 
containing their values. These secondary quantities will be referred to as 
AUXILIARY variables. Usually the inclusion of AUXILIARY variables is optional, 
but there are some format options in which they are required because they 
provide information about the ensuing data records. Both PRIMARY and AUXILIARY 
variables are considered as dependent variables, and are always recorded with 
reference to at least one INDEPENDENT variable. INDEPENDENT variables can be 
time, spatial coordinates, index values, or any other monotonic quantity that 
can be used to uniquely identify a particular PRIMARY variable value. Each 
INDEPENDENT variable represents a dimension on which the PRIMARY variables are 
dependent. PRIMARY variables are considered as discrete functions of the 
INDEPENDENT variables, whereas AUXILIARY variables are associated with an 
explicitly recorded INDEPENDENT variable. </P>
<P>The information recorded within exchange files is of two types, either 
numeric or character string. Character strings may contain any printable ASCII 
character (ASCII decimal values between 32 and 126 inclusive), whereas numeric 
values are restricted to characters 0 through 9, the plus sign, the minus sign, 
the period, and the letter E used in exponential notation. Except for the 
purpose noted in Section 3, an exchange file must not contain non-printable 
ASCII characters. The non-printable characters have ASCII decimal values of 0 
through 31, and values greater than 126. </P>
<P>Each exchange file has a file header which conveys information about the 
PRIMARY, AUXILIARY, and INDEPENDENT variables, and the order in which they are 
recorded in the file. Rather than attempt to pre-define a single file header 
format which accounts for all existing data formats, as well as any future 
formats, a File Format Index (FFI) is used to uniquely define the exchange file 
format. By reference to pre-defined format options, the value of the FFI 
determines the number of INDEPENDENT variables, whether the values of the 
INDEPENDENT and dependent variables are numeric or character string, the format 
of the file header, and the format of the data records. </P>
<P>Included in the file header are descriptions and/or units of measure for the 
INDEPENDENT, PRIMARY, and AUXILIARY variables. All variables must be defined in 
the records in which they are expected to appear, and cannot be omitted or have 
blank spaces substituted for their values. Associated with each PRIMARY and 
AUXILIARY variable is a "missing" value to denote missing or erroneous data 
values. These missing values must be larger than any "good" data values recorded 
within the file so that a simple test on the magnitude of a data value will 
determine if it represents missing or usable data. A scale factor is associated 
with each numeric PRIMARY and AUXILIARY variable. The scale factors are included 
to encourage recording of the data as scaled whole numbers, without a decimal 
point or exponential notation, and thus reduce the size of the file. There are 
no scale factors or missing values for the INDEPENDENT variables. </P>
<P>The order in which the PRIMARY and AUXILIARY variables are defined in the 
file header is the same order in which they are recorded in the data records. 
The order in which the INDEPENDENT variables are defined in the file header 
determines the dependence of the PRIMARY variables on the INDEPENDENT variables 
and, therefore, the manner in which the PRIMARY variables are recorded. The 
recorded dependence of the PRIMARY variables on the INDEPENDENT variables is 
such that, from the point of view of writing the data records, the most rapidly 
varying dimension is listed first in the file header, and the most slowly 
varying dimension is listed last. </P>
<P>If the number of values in the most slowly varying dimension is not 
pre-determined (as with the time dimension in many cases) then it is termed the 
unbounded dimension. Of necessity, only one dimension, or INDEPENDENT variable, 
can be unbounded, while the others, if any, must be bounded. The number of 
values in the bounded dimensions are defined in either the file header or the 
data records. Values of the unbounded INDEPENDENT variable are explicitly 
recorded at pre-determined locations within the data records and are termed 
INDEPENDENT VARIABLE MARKS. The AUXILIARY variables, if any, are specified 
immediately after the INDEPENDENT VARIABLE MARKS, either within the same record 
or the subsequent records. The unbounded INDEPENDENT variable must be a 
monotonic quantity. The bounded INDEPENDENT variables, for a given INDEPENDENT 
VARIABLE MARK, must also be monotonic. </P>
<P>As an illustration, consider airborne lidar measurements of ozone, recorded 
as a time sequence of vertical profiles of ozone. For this example, ozone number 
density is the PRIMARY variable, altitude above Earth's surface is the bounded 
INDEPENDENT variable, and a monotonic measure of time is the unbounded 
INDEPENDENT variable. The same records which contain time may also contain 
AUXILIARY variables. Since ozone values at all recorded altitudes are read for 
each time mark, the dependence on altitude is considered the more rapidly 
varying dependence, so altitude is the first INDEPENDENT variable defined in the 
file header; time is defined second in the file header. An examination of the 
standard formats in Section 6 reveals that there are several file formats which 
could accommodate the data in this example, the selection of the most 
appropriate format depends on the nature of the altitude measurements. If the 
values of altitude are constant then FFI 2010 could be used, with the monotonic, 
constant altitudes defined in the file header. In this instance, AUXILIARY 
variables are optional, but one may wish to include additional information, say, 
aircraft longitude and latitude, in the AUXILIARY variable list. If the altitude 
values are variable, but the interval between the altitudes is constant, then 
FFI 2310 is more appropriate. In this instance the number of altitudes, base 
altitude value, and altitude increment are supplied in the AUXILIARY variable 
list. If the altitude values and the intervals between altitudes are variable 
then FFI 2110 is the most appropriate option, with the number of altitudes given 
in the AUXILIARY variable list, and the altitude values read from the records 
containing the ozone values. In these last two instances (FFI 2310, 2110), the 
indicated AUXILIARY variables are required, in the sense that they provide 
necessary information for reading subsequent data records, but one still has the 
option to include additional AUXILIARY variables. Also, the values of the 
bounded INDEPENDENT variable (altitude) in FFI 2110 and 2310 can be different 
for each INDEPENDENT VARIABLE MARK (time mark) and, therefore, are dependent on 
the unbounded INDEPENDENT VARIABLE. For each time mark the altitude values must 
be monotonic. </P>
<P>The file header also contains information on the originators of the exchange 
file and their affiliations, the source of the PRIMARY variables, the mission 
which the data supports, and (by popular demand) the number of lines in the file 
header. The originators will often be the principal investigators for a 
particular instrument or model simulation, and the instrument and platform, or 
model, will be the source. At the beginning of each mission, a mission name will 
be decided upon and used in all exchange files. </P>
<P>Also included, are the date for which the data applies, the date the data was 
reduced or revised (not necessarily the date the file was written, although the 
two may be the same), the volume number for the exchange file, and the total 
number of volumes required to record the complete dataset. For large datasets 
requiring more than one volume of the medium on which they are written 
(diskette, etc.), the data are continued in a new file, on a new volume, and 
after a file header with an incremented volume counter (see IVOL, NVOL in 
Section 5). </P>
<P>There are allowances for three types of comments in the file header. Two of 
these comment types have reserved locations within the file header, and are 
associated with counters defining the number of lines occupied by each type of 
comment. The first type is for more complete descriptions of the variables, 
instrument, or other comments that apply in general to all of a particular kind 
of dataset; these are called normal comments. The second type, called special 
comments, are reserved to note special problems or circumstances concerning the 
data within a specific exchange file. If the exchange file is a revised dataset 
then it is recommended that the special comments describe how it differs from 
the previous version of the dataset. The third type of comments are merely 
annotations which may follow numeric values; these comments must be contained on 
the same line as, and separated by at least one space from the last numeric 
value expected in the record. They should not be included in lines containing 
character values because the annotations can not easily be separated from the 
character string values. </P>
<P>The data records immediately follow the file header records and continue to 
the end of the file. One or more spaces (ASCII decimal value 32) delimit 
successive numeric values within a line in both the file header and the data 
records. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<CENTER>
<H2>3</H2></CENTER>
<CENTER>
<H2>Implementation Considerations</H2></CENTER>
<P>Even though an ASCII file is the most universally readable type of file, 
there are differences in the way different operating systems define the end of a 
line for ASCII text files. Therefore, some consideration must be given to the 
way in which files are transferred between machines with different operating 
systems. </P>
<P>MS DOS uses the ASCII characters for carriage return <CR>and line feed <LF>to 
terminate each line, Macintosh uses just <CR>, Unix uses just <LF>, whereas 
VAX/VMS has control words at the beginning of each line which give the number of 
characters in the line. It is, therefore, impracticable to write an ASCII file 
which will appear as a native to every operating system. If inter-system file 
transfers are performed using some of the "standard" file transfer software 
(Kermit, FTP, DECnet-DOS, etc.) then the conversion to the appropriate 
end-of-line designator is done automatically during the file transfer, assuming 
it is not a bit for bit (binary) transfer. But if the file is written to some 
storage medium (diskette, tape, compact disc, etc.) under one operating system, 
and read from the medium by another operating system, then it may be necessary 
to rewrite or edit the file to a form with the appropriate end-of-line 
designator. Analogous to the end-of-line designator, the end-of-file designator 
differs with different operating systems, but is appropriately converted using 
standard file transfer software. </P>
<P>There is currently no convenient solution to the above stated dilemma. It is 
mentioned mainly to alert originators and users of exchange files to the 
potential problems with transferring ASCII files between different operating 
systems. In the past, the MS DOS designators have been the convention for 
transferring files via diskette and compact disc, but this may change as 
technology and industry standards change. In any case, prior to each mission, 
the mode of file transfer, and the acceptable end-of-line and end-of-file 
designators, will be decided upon and communicated to the project participants. 
</P>
<P>Except for the purpose of preparing a file for use on a different operating 
system, there must not be any extraneous non-printable ASCII characters within 
an exchange file. The non-printable characters have ASCII decimal values of 0 
through 31, and values greater than 126. For similar reasons, exchange files 
must not be Fortran output files with Fortran carriage control characters 
embedded within the file. </P>
<P>Programming languages impose limitations on record length, magnitudes of 
integer and real numbers, and precision of real numbers. To comply with 
limitations in the most commonly used environments, the maximum record length in 
exchange files is 32766 characters. It is suggested that all numeric values be 
limited to seven significant digits within the magnitude range of 1.0E-38 to 
1.0E+38. </P>
<P>For numeric data, there should be an adequate number of digits to resolve the 
anticipated precision, but in the interest of minimizing the file size, the 
number of digits should not be larger than necessary. Also, unnecessary records 
of missing values should not be used to pad the beginning or end of the data 
section of an exchange file. If, for example, the data from an airborne 
instrument begins 10 minutes after takeoff, and terminates 10 minutes before 
landing, it is unnecessary to include 10 minutes of missing values before the 
data begins and after it terminates. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<CENTER>
<H2>4</H2></CENTER>
<CENTER>
<H2>Notation</H2></CENTER>
<P>The array and implied loop notation, used to generalize the exchange file 
format definitions given in Section 6, will now be explained. The notation is 
merely a convenient means of specifying the file formats, and not intended to 
indicate useful or desirable array structures in computer programs. </P>
<P>Quantities enclosed in square brackets [ ] are read with one "read" statement 
and, therefore, the quantities occupy one record which may exceed one line. One 
or more quantities appearing in a line, and not enclosed in square brackets, are 
read as one record and constitute one line in the exchange file. Similar 
comments apply to writing the records, but the descriptions which follow in this 
Section are from the perspective of reading the records. </P>
<P>The indices act merely as counters to indicate the dependence of some 
variable, but several indices are consistently used for special purposes. The 
index m is always used to count independent variable marks, and the implied loop 
over m is unbounded. The index s is the counter for the independent variables 
(dimensions), n for the primary variables, and a for the auxiliary variables. 
The usage of other indices (i,j,k) is less consistent, but usually they are 
counters for the bounded independent variable values. </P>
<P>Consider the array X, which contains values of the independent variables on 
which the primary variables are dependent. To reference a specific array element 
we write X(2,1). To reference a general array element we write X(i,s), where i 
and s can assume any allowable values. To indicate the allowable range of values 
for i and s we write X(i,s), i=1,NX(s), s=1,NIV; which states that s may take on 
integer values of 1 to NIV, and i may assume integer values of 1 to NX(s), the 
value of NX depending on the value of s. NIV is the number of independent 
variables, and NX(s) is the number of values for the s-th independent variable. 
</P>
<P>Now consider the array V(X,n), which contains values of the primary variables 
as functions of two independent variables. Since NIV=2, V(X,n) may also be 
expressed as V(X(i,1),X(m,2),n), or simply as V(i,m,n). To completely specify 
the contents of V we write V(i,m,n), i=1,NX(1), n=1,NV, where NV is the number 
of primary variables, and NX(1) is the number of bounded independent variable 
values. It is implied that m can pertain to any independent variable mark within 
the file. </P>
<P>For reading data records, the implied loop notation has a slightly different 
meaning, because then it implies that during the read operation the loop index 
will sequentially take on the values dictated by the loop limits. If the 
terminal value of a loop is smaller than the initial value, the implication is 
that the loop is not executed. Let the general expression for the data format 
be:<BR><BR>[ X(m,2) ( A(m,a), a=1,NAUXV ) ]<BR>[ V(i,m,n), i=1,NX(1) ] 
n=1,NV<BR></P>
<P>In the above expressions X(m,2) represents the m-th independent variable mark 
for the unbounded independent variable; A(m,a) is the value of the a-th 
auxiliary variable at the m-th independent variable mark; and V(i,m,n) is the 
value of the n-th primary variable at the m-th independent variable mark and 
i-th bounded independent variable value. NAUXV is the number of auxiliary 
variables. </P>
<P>The square brackets enclosing the first line of the expression indicate that 
an independent variable mark and NAUXV auxiliary variables are read as one 
record which may span more than one line. The second line of the expression is 
to be interpreted to mean that for the m-th independent variable mark there are 
NV records of primary variables, which will be read with n starting at a value 
of 1, incrementing by one for each record, and ending with a value of NV for the 
last record. The notation within the square brackets indicates that, for each 
record, NX(1) values of the n-th primary variable at the m-th independent 
variable mark are read. In this case, the constant values of the bounded 
independent variable (X(i,1), i=1,NX(1)) are read from the file header. </P>
<P>To be more specific, assume there are three auxiliary variables (NAUXV=3), 
two primary variables (NV=2), and four values for the bounded independent 
variable (NX(1)=4). Given these values for the loop limits, the general 
expressions for the data format imply the following record structure (the 
intra-record spacing between values is merely for clarity):<BR><BR>[ X(m,2) 
A(m,1) A(m,2) A(m,3) ]<BR>[ V(1,m,1) V(2,m,1) V(3,m,1) V(4,m,1) ]<BR>[ V(1,m,2) 
V(2,m,2) V(3,m,2) V(4,m,2) ]<BR>[ X(m+1,2) A(m+1,1) A(m+1,2) A(m+1,3) ]<BR>[ 
V(1,m+1,1) V(2,m+1,1) V(3,m+1,1) V(4,m+1,1) ]<BR>[ V(1,m+1,2) V(2,m+1,2) 
V(3,m+1,2) V(4,m+1,2) ]<BR>[ X(m+2,2) A(m+2,1) A(m+2,2) A(m+2,3) ]<BR>etc., etc. 
</P>
<P>If, for the sake of illustration, NAUXV=0 then according to the loop limits 
in the general expressions for the data format given above, the terminal value 
of the loop would be smaller than the initial value. The implication would then 
be that no auxiliary variables were present in the file and, therefore, none 
would be read from the file. The data records would remain the same as those in 
the above example, with the exception that there would be no auxiliary variables 
in the records containing the independent variable marks. </P>

<DL>
  <DT>A(m,a):
  <DD>value of the a-th auxiliary variable at the m-th independent variable mark 
  (a=1,NAUXV). If A(m,a) is real, the use of scaled whole numbers is encouraged. 

  <DT>AMISS(a):
  <DD>a quantity indicating missing or erroneous data for the a-th auxiliary 
  variable. The value of AMISS(a) must be larger than any "good" value of A(m,a) 
  recorded in the file. The value of AMISS(a) defined in the file header is the 
  same value that appears in the data records for missing/bad values of A(m,a). 
  <DT>ANAME(a):
  <DD>a character string specifying the name and/or description of the a-th 
  auxiliary variable, on one line and not exceeding 132 characters. Include 
  units of measure the data will have after multiplying by the a-th scale 
  factor, ASCAL(a). The order in which the auxiliary variable names are listed 
  in the file header is the same order in which the auxiliary variables are read 
  from the data records, and the same order in which the auxiliary variable 
  scale factors and missing values are read from the file header records. 
  <DT>ASCAL(a):
  <DD>scale factor (real) by which one multiplies recorded values of the a-th 
  auxiliary variable to convert them to the units specified in ANAME(a). 
  <DT>character string:
  <DD>a string of at most 132 printable ASCII characters occupying one line of 
  an exchange file. The printable ASCII characters have ASCII decimal values 
  between 32 and 126 inclusive. 
  <DT>DATE:
  <DD>UT date at which the data within the exchange file begins. For aircraft 
  data files DATE is the UT date of takeoff. DATE is in the form YYYY MM DD 
  (year, month, day) with each integer value separated by at least one space. 
  For example: 1989 1 16 or 1989 01 16 for 16 January 1989. 
  <DT>DX(s):
  <DD>interval (real) between values of the s-th independent variable, X(i,s), 
  i=1,NX(s); in the same units as specified in XNAME(s). DX(s) is zero for a 
  non-uniform interval. DX(s) is non-zero for a constant interval. If DX(s) is 
  non-zero then it is required that NX(s) = (X(NX(s),s)-X(1,s)) / DX(s) + 1. For 
  some file formats the value of DX also depends on the unbounded independent 
  variable and is expressed as DX(m,s). 
  <DT>FFI:
  <DD>file format index (integer). The FFI uniquely defines the file header and 
  data formats. It is the second value recorded on the first line of an exchange 
  file. The first (left-most) digit in the FFI gives the number of independent 
  variables listed in the file header, the second digit gives the number of 
  required (in the sense that they are necessary for reading the subsequent data 
  records) auxiliary variables. The remaining digits are used to loosely 
  associate file formats with similar characteristics. 
  <DT>independent variable mark:
  <DD>a value of the unbounded independent variable which is explicitly recorded 
  in the data records. Independent variable marks must be monotonic. 
  <DT>integer:
  <DD>a whole number written without a decimal point. Leading zeros are 
  insignificant. 
  <DT>IVOL:
  <DD>volume number (integer) of the total number of volumes required to store a 
  complete dataset, assuming only one file per volume. To be used in conjunction 
  with NVOL to allow data exchange of large datasets requiring more than one 
  volume of the exchange medium (diskette, etc.). 
  <DT>LENA(a):
  <DD>integer number of characters used to record auxiliary variable A(m,a) when 
  A(m,a) is represented as a character string. The value of LENA(a) must be less 
  than 133. 
  <DT>LENX(s):
  <DD>integer number of characters used to record independent variable X(i,s) 
  when X(i,s) is represented as a character string. The value of LENX(s) must be 
  less than 133. 
  <DT>line:
  <DD>refers to a string of printable ASCII characters within an exchange file, 
  terminated by the appropriate end-of-line (or new line) designator for the 
  operating system on which the file resides. The maximum number of printable 
  characters per line is 132. 
  <DT>MNAME:
  <DD>a character string specifying the mission which the data is supporting, on 
  one line and not exceeding 132 characters. The appropriate value for MNAME 
  will be decided upon prior to the start of the mission. 
  <DT>NAUXC:
  <DD>number of auxiliary variables (integer) whose values are recorded as 
  character strings. If NAUXC=0 then no auxiliary variables are recorded as 
  character strings. 
  <DT>NAUXV:
  <DD>number of auxiliary variables (integer). If NAUXV=0 then no auxiliary 
  variables are recorded and no missing values, scale factors, or names for the 
  auxiliary variables are present in the file header. 
  <DT>NCOM(k):
  <DD>a character string containing the k-th normal comment line (k=1,NNCOML). 
  <DT>NIV:
  <DD>number of independent variables (integer) on which the primary variables 
  are dependent. 
  <DT>NLHEAD:
  <DD>number of lines (integer) composing the file header. NLHEAD is the first 
  recorded value on the first line of an exchange file. 
  <DT>NNCOML:
  <DD>number of normal comment lines (integer) within the file header, including 
  blank lines and data column headers, etc. Normal comments are those which 
  apply to all of a particular kind of dataset, and can be used to more 
  completely describe the contents of the file. If NNCOML=0 then there are no 
  normal comment lines. 
  <DT>NSCOML:
  <DD>number of special comment lines (integer) within the file header. Special 
  comments are reserved to note special problems or circumstances concerning the 
  data within a specific exchange file so they may easily be found and flagged 
  by those reading the file. If NSCOML=0 then there are no special comment 
  lines. 
  <DT>NV:
  <DD>number of primary variables in the exchange file (integer). 
  <DT>NVOL:
  <DD>total number of volumes (integer) required to store the complete dataset, 
  assuming one file per volume. If NVOL&gt;1 then each volume must contain a 
  file header with an incremented value for IVOL, and continue the data records 
  with monotonic independent variable marks. 
  <DT>NVPM(s):
  <DD>integer number of independent variable values between independent variable 
  marks, for the s-th independent variable. NVPM(s) = (X(m+1,s)-X(m,s)) / DX(s). 

  <DT>NX(s):
  <DD>number of values (integer) for the s-th independent variable. If NX(s) is 
  defined in the file header then it represents the constant number of values 
  for the s-th independent variable. Otherwise, NX=NX(m,s) is defined in the 
  data records and its values can vary with the independent variable marks. In 
  the case of an unbounded independent variable, NX(NIV) is never specified in 
  the file but the values of X(m,NIV) are read from the data records 
  (independent variable marks). 
  <DT>NXDEF(s):
  <DD>number of values (integer) of the s-th independent variable which are 
  explicitly defined in the file header. If NXDEF(s)=NX(s) then all values of 
  X(i,s), i=1,NX(s) are recorded in the file header. If NXDEF(s)=1 then only the 
  first value, X(1,s), is recorded in the file header and the remaining values 
  of X(i,s) are calculated as X(i,s) = X(1,s) + (i-1) * DX(s) for i=2,NX(s). 
  <DT>ONAME:
  <DD>a character string specifying the name(s) of the originator(s) of the 
  exchange file, last name first. On one line and not exceeding 132 characters. 
  <DT>ORG:
  <DD>character string specifying the organization or affiliation of the 
  originator of the exchange file. Can include address, phone number, email 
  address, etc. On one line and not exceeding 132 characters. 
  <DT>RDATE:
  <DD>date of data reduction or revision, in the same form as DATE. 
  <DT>real:
  <DD>a real valued number that may include a decimal point or be written in 
  exponential notation. It is preferred that the values of real numbers be 
  limited to seven significant digits within the magnitude range of 1.0E-38 to 
  1.0E+38. 
  <DT>record:
  <DD>a logical record to be read by one "read" statement. The maximum record 
  length is 32766 characters with a maximum of 132 characters per line. The 
  first character of a record is also the first character of a line. 
  <DT>SCOM(k):
  <DD>a character string containing the k-th special comment line (k=1,NSCOML). 
  <DT>SNAME:
  <DD>a character string specifying the source of the measurements or model 
  results which compose the primary variables, on one line and not exceeding 132 
  characters. Can include instrument name, measurement platform, etc. 
  <DT>V(X,n):
  <DD>value of n-th primary variable (n=1,NV) at specified values of independent 
  variables X. If V is real then the use of scaled whole numbers, without 
  decimal points, is encouraged. 
  <DT>VMISS(n):
  <DD>a quantity indicating missing or erroneous data values for the n-th 
  primary variable. VMISS(n) must be larger than any "good" data value, of the 
  n-th primary variable, recorded in the file. The value of VMISS(n) defined in 
  the file header is the same value that appears in the data records for 
  missing/bad values of V(X,n). 
  <DT>VNAME(n):
  <DD>a character string giving the name and/or description of the n-th primary 
  variable, on one line and not exceeding 132 characters. Include units of 
  measure the data will have after multiplying by the n-th scale factor, 
  VSCAL(n). The order in which the primary variable names are listed in the file 
  header is the same order in which the primary variables are read from the data 
  records, and the same order in which scale factors and missing values for the 
  primary variables are read from the file header records. 
  <DT>VSCAL(n):
  <DD>scale factor (real) by which one multiplies recorded values of the n-th 
  primary variable to convert them to the units specified in VNAME(n). 
  <DT>X(i,s):
  <DD>i-th value of the s-th independent variable (X(i,s), i=1,NX(s), s=1,NIV). 
  For some file formats the values of a bounded independent variable may also 
  depend on the unbounded independent variable, and in those cases we will 
  denote the bounded independent variable as X(i,m,s), with s<NIV. <dt 
  monotonic. be must i="1,NX(s))" (X(i,m,s), and (X(i,s), of Values>XNAME(s):
  <DD>a character string giving the name and/or description of the s-th 
  independent variable, on one line and not exceeding 132 characters. Include 
  units of measure and order the independent variable names such that, when 
  reading primary variables from the data records, the most rapidly varying 
  independent variable is listed first and the most slowly varying independent 
  variable is listed last. </DD></DL>

<P>Examples of the file formats, ordered by increasing file format index, are 
given in this Section. These are fictitious examples and any similarity with 
existing exchange files is purely a manifestation of the author's lack of 
imagination. For each example is a file header, followed by a sample of the data 
records. Numeric constants in the file headers have been annotated with comments 
enclosed by { }. The annotations are included here as references and need not 
appear in exchange files. The data records in some of the examples have also 
been annotated, but those are solely for illustration since annotations should 
not appear in the data records of exchange files. </P>
