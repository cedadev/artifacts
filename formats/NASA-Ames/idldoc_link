AMES ACCESS ROUTINES

   The following set of programs and routines are intended to be used with
   data sets that are formatted as described in "Format Specification for
   Data Exchange" written by S. Gaines and S. Hipskind, Feb. 1992.  This 
   document is located at /oracle_db/ndsc/ames/gaines2.ps in PostScript form.

   Two types of access routines are available:  a format checking program,
   dataex, and an IDL reading/plotting program, xchgread.

I   Location 
     Copy the files from the following directories to your user area.

     Format checking routines (dataex):  /oracle_db/ndsc/ames/format
     IDL reading routines (xchgread):    /oracle_db/ndsc/ames/idl
 
II IDL Read Routines (xchgread)
     Author:    T. Atwater NASA/GSFC  4-5-91.  Small modifcations have been 
     made by J. Wild RDC at NMC/CAC and T. Hallihan.

     The IDL version of the Ames format reader, XCHGREAD.PRO, reads the 
     Ames header and data into IDL structures.  These data are then 
     available for plotting.  Often it is desirable to use the header 
     information, particularly the variable names, as graph titles.  
     Since structures are available only in the second version of IDL, 
     this reading program is not compatable with IDL1.
  

    A.  Location
        The IDL read routines routines are located in the directory:
        /oracle_db/ndsc/ames/idl.  Copy the file xchgread.pro to your user 
        area.

    B.  File descriptions
        xchgread.pro  The IDL read routines for Ames data -- copy this file to
                      your user area.
        test2110.pro  A sample prgram for reading and plotting data from a 
                      file.  This routine reads the datafile and creates 
                      successive plots of the primary variable data.v(*,0:nv) 
                      vs. the bounded independant variable data.x0(i,*).  This 
                      routine is written for format 2110 data.  With minor 
                      modifications it will work for several other formats.
        2110h.d       Test 2110 data file with database header

    C.  Running the code
        All of the necessary procedures are contained in xchgread.pro.  The 
        main routine is at the end of the file because IDL requires the 
        compilation of the subroutines before the compilation of the calling 
        routine.  Enter the IDL shell by typing idl at the prompt.  Then 
        compile by typing 
               .run xchgread
        or 
               .rnew xchgread
        The calling sequence is

          xchgread, in_file_name, head, data, $
             headdb=db_head,d=in_dir,type=file_type,vol1=vol_1,  $
             comments=c_flag,r=ret_code

        Note:  Using /keyword sets the keyword to 1, ie /comments in the 
        calling sequence is the same as comments=1.

    D.  Input Parameters
        INPUTS:
        in_file_name = Data exchange file name
                       *NOTE - file volume number must be the very last 
                       character in the file name.
        
        KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
        in_dir    = directory containing data exchange file (input)
        db_head   = flag to indicate if file contains database header (input)
                  = 1 if file contains UARS header 
                  = 0 if file does not contain UARS header 
        vol_1     = Volume request flag (input)
                  =1, Read only this particular data volume
                  =0, Read all data volumes corresponding to this file 
                      name (default)
        c_flag    = Comment print request flag (input)
                  =1, Echo all comments in file to standard output
                  =0, Do not echo (default)
        ret_code  = return code (output)
                  = 0, success
                  = -1, Error reading exchange file
                  = -2, Invalid file format index read from exchange file


    E.  Output
        IN GENERAL: All data is returned exactly as read, in either 
           floating point or string format as appropriate. 
           (Exception: 'date' is returned as 'ddmmyy'.)  For more information
           see the documentation in the body of the idl code xchgread.pro.

    F.  Sample_run
        The following is an example session with test2110.pro.  It 
        assumes that you are in the directory that contains 
        test2110.pro, xchgread.pro, and 2110h.dat.  Note first the
        user enters the idl shell by typing "idl".  Then the xchgread code is
        compiled.  Finally the test program is run.  This program plots
        each primary variable and then stops.  The program is restarted
        by typing ".con", at which point the next primary varaible is plotted.
        The idl shell is exited by typing "exit".
