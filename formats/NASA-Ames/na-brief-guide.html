<h1>Brief guide to NASA-Ames<br clear=all></h1>
<BR><HR>
</P>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
The NASA Ames format is a text-based, self-describing, portable format. File contents are 
limited to the printable ASCII character set (ASCII codes 32 to 126).
Each NASA Ames file is made up of a file header section and a data
section.  The file header contains the information needed to make the file
self describing, as well as giving information such as the origin of the data. 
Once the form of a file for a particular instrument has been decided, the file
header for that instrument changes little from file to file.  
The data section lists the data, in a column-oriented format. 

<P>
<h2>The Header</h2>
<P>
The header of a NASA-Ames format file must contain the following descriptors
in the order listed below:

<OL>
<LI><a href="#format">Overall Format description</a>
<LI><a href="#source">Data Source Description and Storage Volume Information</a>
<LI><a href="#independent">Description(s) of the Independent variable(s)</a>
<LI><a href="#primary">Description(s) of the Primary variable(s)</a>
<LI><a href="#auxiliary">Descriptions of the Auxiliary variable(s)</a>
<LI><a href="#comments">Special and Normal Comments </a>
</OL>
</p>

<H3><A NAME="format">1. Overall Format Description</A></H3>

<P>
The first line of a NASA-Ames file always contains two integers (e.g. 20 1001).
The first integer represents the number of header lines in the file, 
including the first line itself.

The second integer is a four-digit number called the
file format index (FFI). The first digit of the FFI indicates the number of independent variables 
(dimensions). The next digit specifies the number of necessary auxiliary variables. The remaining differences cover 
the way the independent variables increment and the nature (numeric or character) of
the variables.
</P>

<H3><A NAME="source">2. The Data "Source" Description and Storage Volume
Information</A></H3>

<P>
The data source description requires six lines:

<UL>

<LI>Lines 2 and 3 describe the name and affiliation of the originator(s) of the file.

<LI>Lines 4 and 5 are the instrument name and campaign name.

<LI>Line 6 gives the current volume and the number of volumes in
the dataset. This information dates from the days when data were distributed
on diskettes - for most files today the numbers are 1 and 1.

<LI>Finally line 7 provides two dates. The
first is the date on which the data starts
while the second is the date when the file was created.
All dates are given in in "YYYY MM DD" format.

</UL>
</P>

<H3><A NAME="independent">3. Description of the Independent variable (or variables) </A></H3>

<P>
The independent variable(s) are used to define the dimensions (or 'axes') of the
data, and must be <em>monotonic</em> meaning increasing but never decreasing or 
decreasing but never increasing. The description of the independent variable(s) changes 
based on whether they are what is called bounded or unbounded and whether they are numeric or character variables. 
With bounded variables, the range of values in known in advance, and the range and interval must be specified
either within the NASA-Ames file header or,
as is the case with some formats, as auxiliary variables.
Thus if an independent variable (e.g. time) interval is always the same, you can specify the interval between
different points in the header. If the spacing between points can change
then this interval should be set to zero. With an unbounded variable this range is unknown
until after the file has been completely read.
It is meaningless to have more than one unbounded variable in a NASA-Ames
format file.
</P>

<H3><A NAME="primary">4. Description of the Primary variable (or
variables) </A></H3>

<p>Primary variables are the main variables that are in the file: they are the
quantities that have been observed or derived e.g. temperature, winds or ozone.
The primary variables are considered
as functions of the independent variables.
Three quantities are needed to describe each primary
variable: the name, the value which has been substituted for missing data and the scaling factor by which one 
multiples recorded values to produce the required values.
The variable name should be chosen from the <a href="http://www.cfconventions.org"> 
Climate and Forecast (CF) Metadata Conventions</a> 
standard names list and must include the units. 
</P>

<P>
The format stipulates that all scale factors
for the different primary variables should be held on the same line,
all missing data values should be held in the next line
and each primary variable name should be written
in separate subsequent lines. 
</P>


<H3><A NAME="auxiliary">5. Description of the Auxiliary variable (or variables) </A></H3>

<P>
<p>The auxiliary variables are used for ancillary information about the
observations, if this is needed. Three quantities are needed to describe each auxiliary
variable although these vary depending on whether the variable is
numeric or a character string.
Numeric auxiliary variables require a scaling factor,
a default value to be substituted when data are missing and the CF name of the
variable.
Character auxiliary variables require the length of the string,
a default string for missing data and the CF name of the variable(s).
</P>


<H3><A NAME="comments">6. The normal and special comments fields </A></H3>

<P>
The format makes provision for two comment fields
structured in identical ways. The first line is the number of comment lines and 
subsequent lines are the actual comments. These can include community preferred names for
variables and/or a column headings line. Either one or
both of these can be missing.
</P>

<P>
<h2>The Data</h2>
<P>
The data section consists of columns of data with the structure of independent, auxiliary 
and primary variables set for each file format index.
