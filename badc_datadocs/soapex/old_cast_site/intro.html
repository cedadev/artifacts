 Oxidation of almost all trace gases released into the atmosphere is initiated
 by hydroxyl (OH) radicals, produced mainly from the action of near-UV light on
 ozone in the presence of water vapour.  Increasing evidence suggests that the 
oxidative capacity of the troposphere has been perturbed in recent years due to
 the emission of gases such as methane, carbon monoxide, non-methane 
hydrocarbons  and nitrogen oxides from man-made sources.  These perturbations 
may be causing changes in the natural atmospheric composition, for instance 
increasing tropospheric levels of the greenhouse gas ozone, which has important 
consequences for climate and human health.  It is also possible that the rates
 of oxidation of gases such as methane, and production of sulphate aerosols 
from the oxidation of sulphur dioxide, have been modified.  Taken together a 
change in the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere has many consequences for
 the long-term stability of the Earth's climate.</P> 

<P>SOAPEX-2 builds upon the success of the original SOAPEX-I experiment 
conducted at Cape Grim in January/February 1995 which resulted in the 
publication of several papers to the literature on the relationship between
 concentrations of peroxy radicals and uv light levels in different NO<I>x</I> 
concentration regimes, and the consequences for ozone production and loss in 
the marine boundary layer. SOAPEX-2 is a more complete experiment with the 
addition of atmospheric measurements of key new species including hydroxyl,
 hydroperoxyl, halogen oxide and nitrate radicals, non methane hydrocarbons,
 speciated aldehydes, PAN and halocarbons.
