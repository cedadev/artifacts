<P><STRONG>ATLAS-8 </STRONG>describes the collection of data compiled
from MOHSST6 and represents a major upgrade of ATLAS-7. Most files
in ATLAS-8 contain data through December 1995, except where indicated.

<P>The bucket corrections for the SST data are from Folland and
Parker, 1995 (see <A HREF="refs.html">Ref. 1</A>).
The SST climatology is based on work described by Parker, D.E.,
et al, 1995 (see <A HREF="refs.html">Ref. 4</A>).

<P>The surface flux values are derived from work by Zhongxiang
Wu using an updated version of the Comprehensive Ocean Atmosphere
Data Set (COADS) and a modified set of bulk equations recently
recommended by the oceanographic community (see <A HREF="refs.html">Ref.
6 </A>).

<P>The reference period for the climatologies and anomalies is
1961 to 1990, except for the heat flux data which are for 1949
to 1990.

  <P><STRONG>MOHSST6</STRONG> (Met Office Historical
  Sea Surface Temperature) describes SST data compiled in January
  1996. This dataset contains monthly values of SST anomaly from
  1865 to 1995 on a 5&deg; x 5&deg; grid. These anomalies are with
  respect to 1961-1990 normals. More recent in-situ data have been
  added and the coverage and quality control procedures have also
  been improved: Parker, D.E., et al, 1995 (see <A HREF="refs.html">Ref.
  3</A>). Normals and statistics (standard deviations, lag correlations
  etc.) have been recalculated using the same ATLAS-7 techniques
  and in most cases the same programs have been used.
  <P><STRONG>MOMAT4N</STRONG> describes the Met Office
  Historical Night Marine Air Temperature data used to create ATLAS-8.
  This data set contains monthly values of NMAT anomaly from 1856
  to 1995 on a 5&deg; x 5&deg; grid. These anomalies are with respect
  to 1961-1990 normals. The data have similar corrections to those
  in ATLAS-7, but night is defined as from sunset + 1 hour to sunrise
  + 1 hour to avoid residual solar heating of the ship's decks. <BR>

  <P><STRONG>MOHAST </STRONG>describes the Met Office
  Historical Air-Sea Temperature difference data. In ATLAS-8 the
  climatology for 1961 to 1990 has been calculated using individual
  nighttime observations of air-sea temperature difference, with
  the difference between the GISST2.0 SST climatology and the MOHMAT4N
  Night Marine Air Temperature (NMAT) climatology as background
