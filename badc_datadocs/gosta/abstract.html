<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>A climatology of global sea surface temperature (SST), based on observations
for the 1951-80 period, is presented in the form of maps on a 5 deg. latitude
X longitude grid. A 1 deg. latitude X longitude grid is used for selected
regions. The data are based on the Meteorological Office Main Marine Data
Bank (MOMMDB), coupled in certain regions after 1960 with the Consolidated
Data Set (CDS) of the US Fleet Numerical Oceanography Center, which together
amount to about 60 million SST reports. Monthly anomalies from the 30-year
means are presented for the periods 1968-77 and 1982-83. Climatological
values of air minus sea temperature and air-sea energy exchange are also
presented. A development of the latter was used to apply approximate provisional
corrections to analysed monthly mean SST values for the 1856-1941 period,
which are believed to have been based mainly on uninsulated bucket data.
Further refinements suggested that these provisional corrections were slightly
too positive before about 1900 and slightly too low in the early 20th Century.
Decadal seasonal mean anomalies are printed for 1866-1985 based on the
provisional corrections, but a set of seasonal time-series and low-pass
filtered time-series of SST for 1856-1989 for selected regions, including
one representative of the entire world ocean, incorporates the refined
corrections, as well as being based on an updated MOMMDB. These time-series
are presented in parallel with series of corrected nighttime marine air
temperatures for comparison. The largest fluctuation in marine temperature
is a substantial temperature drop around 1902-03 with the low values persisting
for about 10 years, and this was evident in most regions. Information is
included on geographical patterns of data coverage, along with statistics
of the quantities of data underlying the climatology and other fields.
Standard deviations and l-month lag correlations of the monthly SST fields
for 1951-80 are also presented. All values in the Atlas Plates, with the
complete 1 deg. resolution climatology are available on a documented CD-ROM
disk or magnetic tape. The disk and tape also hold, if different, corresponding
values based on the updated MOMMDB and with the refined corrections to
SST incorporated where appropriate. In addition, they hold complete sequences
of uncorrected and corrected monthly SST anomalies for 1859-1989 on a 5 deg.
latitude X longitude grid derived from this updated data bank, with the
refined corrections also in a separate file.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>A number of endeavours in meteorology and oceanography require information
about global sea surface temperature patterns and their variation with
time: the planning of oceanographic expeditions designed to study particular
phenomena such as upwelling and oceanic productivity; the reduction of
remote sensing data from satellites which attempt to measure sea surface
temperatures; the construction of numerical models of the ocean and atmosphere,
both separately and jointly; the development of schemes to relate sea surface
temperature to succeeding and preceding atmospheric patterns, which are
part of the larger field of long-range forecasting; investigation of the
El Ni&#241;o-Southern Oscillation phenomenon which in many regions gives rise
to the largest time variability in the tropical atmosphere and ocean; the
computation of the exchange of energy between the atmosphere and ocean
which is an important factor in understanding climatic fluctuations; the
establishment of any systematic variations with time in the observations
such as those which may be associated with the injection of trace constituents
into the atmosphere, e.g. aerosol from volcanoes and carbon dioxide from
the burning of fossil fuel or biomass; studies of the linkage between sea
surface temperature patterns and certain large-scale processes underlying
e.g. drought in the Sahel or the Indian Monsoon; the reduction of palaeo-oceanographic
observations, such as those made on deep sea cores or corals, to environmental
parameters; and the exploration of the general field of ocean fluctuations,
or which the surface temperature patterns are only one manifestation. 

<P>All of these efforts require a global sea surface temperature field
whose values may be compared from one place to another and from one time
to another. The global fleet of merchant and naval vessels make and record
observations of sea and air temperature every 6 hours. A major problem
is to take these observations of sea water temperature, made from a variety
of different types of ships using methods of measuring which have varied
with time, and produce as far as possible a homogeneous data set. While
the largest signal in the time variation of sea surface temperature, the
El Ni&#241;o, may give rise to departures from long-term averages amounting
to 6 deg. C and persisting for several months in certain areas of the tropical
Pacific, the temperature variations in zonal seasonal averages in middle
and high latitudes on a 100-year time-scale are less than one degree Celsius;
thus the utmost care has to be taken in the construction of the averages
and the deviations from the averages. Much of the text which accompanies
the Atlas is devoted to a description of the procedures which have been
devised to minimize this problem. 

<P>The work leading to this Atlas began at Massachusetts Institute of Technology
(MIT) as a study of air-sea interaction over the Pacific, encouraged by
the papers of Namias (1975), but the investigations were soon extended
to the globe using sea surface temperature data provided by the Meteorological
Office at Bracknell. The paper of Sawyer (1965) on physical causes of long-
term atmospheric circulation anomalies, in which the influence of sea surface
temperature anomalies was shown to be substantial, was a major stimulus
to the Meteorological Office work of compiling reliable data sets of sea
surface temperature from their Main Marine Data Bank, as were the subsequent
papers of Murray and Ratcliffe (1969) and Ratcliffe and Murray (1970) on
the use of sea surface temperature for long-range forecasting. In 1980
MIT acquired a separate global marine data set covering the period 1949-79
(the so-called Consolidated Data Set or CDS) from the US Navy Fleet Numerical
Oceanography Center at Monterey, California. The CDS was used to construct
a new set of sea surface temperature averages as well as energy flux values
at the ocean-air interface. The latter was possible because cloudiness,
relative humidity and wind data were included in the CDS. These parameters
are also available in the Meteorological Office Main Marine Data Bank (MOMMDB),
but have not yet been analysed, and in the Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere
Data Set (COADS) which was released by Slutz <I>et al. </I>in 1985. During
1982-83 the Meteorological Office marine temperature data sets were improved
and updated. This entailed re-extraction of the data from the MOMMDB, which
had become fully operational, followed by application of revised quality-
control criteria. Gaps in the MOMMDB data were filled using MIT's CDS values.
By this time it was clear that some of the corrections needed for reduction
of the older sea surface temperature data obtained from uninsulated buckets
could be established to a useful extent by the use of heat-loss rates calculated
using data derived from the CDS. Application of a first attempt at these
corrections was completed in 1987, along with the creation of a globally
complete blended climatology based largely on the quality-controlled MOMMDB
data. 

<P>Completion of the final text represents a milestone in the collation
and application of sea surface temperature data, and in the beneficial
collaboration between the Meteorological Office and MIT.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The original version of this Atlas was sent out for peer review by L.
Cohen of MIT Press. The reviews were supplied to us in May 1987 and a revised
text, taking account of the reviewers' comments, was dated February 1988
and was passed to MIT Press in anticipation of US funding. This funding
had not materialized before November 1989 when an arrangement was made
to print the Atlas at HMSO using funds allocated to the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) by the UK Department of the Environment
and the UK Department of Energy. 

<P>Further refinements were made to the corrections
in 1989, and the final time-series presented in Plates 292-301 have incorporated
these new corrections. However the decadal seasonal means in Plates 244-291
make use of the previous set of corrections.
