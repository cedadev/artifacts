<P><STRONG>ATLAS7</STRONG> describes the collection of data set
compiled in January 1993. They are essentially the same data as
those used in the GOSTA publication which was circulated in 1990:
Bottomley, M. et al. 1990. (See <A HREF="atlas7help.html">GOSTA
Help file</A>).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The surface flux files are taken from work by J. Hsiung, 1986.
(See <A HREF="refs.html">Ref. 7</A>). <BR>
The reference period for the climatologies and anomalies in ATLAS7
is 1951 to 1980, except for heat flux data which are for 1949
to 1979.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><STRONG>MOHSST4</STRONG> (Meteorological Office Historical
  Sea Surface Temperature) describes Sea Surface Temperature (SST)
  data which are quality controlled with extreme values removed.
  These are the data from which the climatology for the normals
  period was computed.
  <P><STRONG>MOHSST5</STRONG> describes SST data which have been
  supplemented with values from the Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere
  Data Set (COADS) and additionally smoothed by spatial interpolation
  techniques: Parker, D.E. et al, 1994. (See <A HREF="refs.html">Ref.5</A>).
  <P><STRONG>MOHMAT2N</STRONG> describes Night Marine Air Temperature
  (NMAT) data which are quality controlled with extreme values
  removed. The Night period is defined as sunset to sunrise. COADS
  data are not included in this data set.</BLOCKQUOTE>
