<BR CLEAR="ALL"><HR ALIGN=LEFT>

<P>The <B><I>Hierarchical Data Format,</I></B> or <B>HDF</B>,
is a multi-object file format for sharing scientific data in a
distributed environment. HDF was created at the National Center
for Supercomputing Applications (<A HREF="http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/"
TARGET="_top">NCSA</A>) to serve the needs of diverse groups of
scientists working on projects in many fields. HDF was designed
to address many requirements for storing scientific data, including:
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>Support for the types of data and metadata commonly used
  by scientists.
  <LI>Efficient storage of and access to large datasets.
  <LI>Platform independence.
  <LI>Extensibility for future enhancements and compatibility with
  other standard formats.
</UL>

<P>HDF files are <B>self-describing</B>. For each data object
in an HDF file, there is information about the type of data, the
amount of data, its dimensions, and its location in the file.
&quot;Self-description&quot; means that many types of data can
be included within an HDF file. For example, it is possible to
have symbolic, numerical, and graphical data within one HDF file.<BR>


<H3>What are GOSTAplus HDF Data Files?</H3>

<P>The <B><I>GOSTAplus HDF Data Files</I></B> are a variation
of one or many Scientific Datasets and Attributes per HDF file.
The scientific datasets are stored in a 16-bit integer data type and
a GOSTAplus HDF&nbsp;data file can contain from 1 to 5 
datasets in 2 or 3 dimensions per dataset. The 29
global attributes contain header information about the particular
dataset such as the complete title of the dataset, conversion
time, data dimension etc,.

<P><B>HDF Library version 4.0r2</B> was used to convert the original
ASCII data to HDF.

<P>Typically, the NCSA HDF libraries are first installed in a
computer, then <I>read programs</I> (in Fortran, C, or other languages)
 call the datasets from the HDF libraries. The programs included with the data, <B>hdf2ascii</B>
and <B>readhdf</B>, come in two formats:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>1) <B>source</B> - allow you to change them but require
  that you install the HDF libraries first.<BR>
  2) <B>executable</B> - ready to use, which include the HDF libraries
  in the executable.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>In addition to readhdf and hdf2ascii, the CD also includes
'<B>jhv</B>', a Java HDF viewer, also developed by NCSA. It allows
you to look inside an HDF file, find the variables and their types,
and to plot certain types of data (some images). The JHV included
here are for the following platforms:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><B>JHV for MacOS<BR>
  JHV for Windows 95/NT</B></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>JHV for other platforms can be downloaded and are available
via NCSA ftp or http sites:
