<P><B>ABSTRACT</B> 

<P>We describe a new geographically complete climatology of sea surface
temperature (SST) and sea-ice for 1961-1990, which was created along with
version 2.2 of the Global sea Ice and Sea Surface Temperature data set
(GISST2.2, Rayner <I>et al</I>., 1995). The climatology was developed using,
as a starting point, a globally complete SST background field. This was
created for each calendar month by averaging the relevant blended satellite
and <I>in situ</I> SST fields for 1982 onwards contained in GISST1.1. <I>In
situ</I> SSTs for each individual month in 1961-1990 were then collated
with SSTs derived statistically for sea-ice margin regions from available
SST data and the observed sea-ice concentrations. The collated data were
then blended with the background field using a method in which the two-dimensional
second derivative of the background field was preserved. The resulting
individual monthly SSI fields were averaged into a monthly climatology
on 10&deg; latitude x longitude resolution. Harmonic synthesis was used
to create a pentad SST climatology, which was further resolved to a daily
climatology using linear interpolation. The daily SST climatology was used
in the quality-control of SST observations during the creation of version
6 of the Meteorological Office Historical Sea Surface Temperature data
set, MOHSST6 which in turn was used in the development of GISST2.2. Following
improved treatment of sea-ice concentrations and ice-zone SSTs in GISST2.2,
we averaged its monthly fields to form the GISST2.2 1961-1990 climatology.
The SST component of this was used again to create pentad and daily climatologies.
Climatological sea-ice concentrations were placed in a companion file.
Comparisons with the older MOHSST4 SST climatology, which was referenced
to 1951-1980, show substantial improvements in the Southern Ocean and an
improved representation of strong climatological gradients, as well as
real worldwide changes consequent on the change of reference period. 

<P><B>1. INTRODUCTION</B> 

<P>Reliable base climatologies are essential for the assessment of climatic
anomalies and the detection of climatic changes, on both global and regional
scales. They are also needed as a reference in the quality-control of observations.
In this paper, we describe the development of a new climatology of sea
surface temperature (SST). The reference period is 1961-1990, the period
of most plentiful data, including satellite-based observations of SST,
permitting very worthwhile improvements in data-sparse regions, in comparison
with climatologies for 1951-1980, e.g. Bottomley <I>et al</I>. (1990).
1961-1990 is also the new World Meteorological Organization standard reference
period, for which land station climatologies have been constructed (Jones,
1994).  

<P>In parts of the midlatitude Southern Ocean, especially in the eastern
Pacific sector, existing climatologies for 1951-1980, even those based
on GISST1.1 (Parker <I>et al</I>., 1995), are substantially biased, by
up to 1&deg;C or more (Parker <I>et al</I>., 1994). The evidence for this
is the persistence of anomalies (i.e. deviations from climatology) of one
sign and of this size in recent decades in data which were referenced to
these climatologies. the biases arose because 1951-1980 <I>in situ</I>
data were too sparse to permit Bottomley <I>et al</I>. (1990) to base their
climatology on them: instead they made substantial use of the climatology
of Alexander and Mobley (1976) who had used earlier data and, in the Southern
Ocean, a bilinear interpolation. This interpolation was especially prone
to error in regions of strong climatological SSI gradient near the oceanic
convergence zones. The Laplacian (or Poisson's equation) bias-adjustment
scheme (Reynolds, 1988) used by Bottomley <I>et al</I>. (1990) will have
reduced the Alexander and Mobley biases somewhat in areas close to locations
where 1951-1980 <I>in situ</I> data were sufficient to calculate a climatology,
but will have had little effect further south where 'ground truth' was
lacking. The GISST1.1 climatology for 1951-1980 had smaller biases than
the climatology of Bottomley <I>et al</I>. (1990), because of the interpolation
of 50 area <I>in situ</I> anomalies from the Meteorological Office Historical
Sea Surface Temperature (MOHSST55) data set into some missing'areas, and
because SSTs near ice-edges were modified in a manner consistent with anomalies
of ice coverage (see Parker <I>et al</I>., 1995). However, some biases
remained because the imperfect Bottomley <I>et al</I>. (1990) climatology
was used as a background field in the creation of GISST1.1 (Parker <I>et
al</I>., 1995).  

<P><B>2. CONSTRUCTION OF NEW CLIMATOLOGY</B> 

<P>We have now created new normals using the 1982-1994 average of GISST1.1
(Parker <I>et al</I>., 1995) as an SST background field. We chose this
background field because it includes satellite SST data; the biases of
the satellite SSTs relative to <I>in situ</I> data had been reduced by
Reynolds' (1988) Laplacian blending technique during the creation of GISST1.1(Parker
<I>et al</I>.; 1995). Because of the satellite data, there are few areas
in which the Bottomley <I>et al</I>. (1990) SST climatology dominates the
new background field.  

<P>We first combined worldwide <I>in situ</I> SST data with statistically-based
estimates of SSTs in sea-ice zones in each individual month in 1961-1990.
The <I>in situ</I> SST data were 1&deg; latitude x longitude monthly 'superobs'
calculated by 'winsorising' (a form of trimmed averaging, in this case
trimming at the outer quartiles, see Bottomley <I>et al</I>., 1990) 1&deg;
latitude x longitude pentad (=5-day) superobs. If there were fewer than
4 pentad superobs, a simple average was used. The pentad superobs had in
turn been calculated by winsorising anomalies based on observations quality-controlled
against the GISST1.1 1951-1980 climatology as described in Appendix 1.
The sea-ice zone SSTs were also on monthly 1&deg; latitude x longitude
resolution and had been specified statistically from observed sea-ice concentrations
as in Section A2.1 of Appendix 2: statistical estimates were overridden
by the <I>in situ</I> superobs wherever these were available.  

<P>These SST data were blended with the SST background field for the relevant
calendar month, by:  

<P>i) conversion to deviations from the background field;  

<P>ii) linear interpolation of these deviations;  

<P>iii) smoothing of the resulting complete field of SST deviations;  

<P>iv) adding back the background field.  

<P>Details are given in Appendix 3 where it is shown that the process conserves
the two-dimensional second derivative of the background field. It is thus
similar to the use of Poisson's equation in interpolation by Bottomley
<I>et al</I>. (1990). The result of the blending process was a set of complete
1&deg; area resolution fields of SST for each month from January 1961 to
December 1990. These fields were averaged to form a new monthly 1961-1990
SST climatology. This climatology was then used as a background field in
a second iteration of stages i) to iv), and the resulting fields were averaged
into a further 'GISST2.0' SST climatology. This climatology was then interpolated
to pentad resolution using harmonic synthesis (Appendix 4), and further
interpolated linearly to give a daily climatology.  

<P>The daily SST climatology for 1961-1990 was used to convert individual
SST observations to anomalies for quality-control and compositing during
the creation of MOHSST6, again using the scheme in Appendix 1. When normals
for pentads (eg Jan 1-5, 6-10 etc) are used to calculate SST anomalies,
as was done by Bottomley <I>et al</I>. (1990), the annual cycle causes
some scatter, especially in transition seasons (Trenberth <I>et al</I>.
(1992)). Our new procedure avoids this problem, as recommended by Trenberth
<I>et al</I>.  

<P>The MOHSST6 data set was the major SST input to GISST2.2 (Rayner et
al., 1995). The monthly GISST2.2 SST fields from 1949 to 1981 are based
mainly on reconstructions using eigenvectors of SST anomalies with 2&deg;
x 2&deg; spatial resolution, with the GISST2.0 1&deg; x l&deg; spatial
resolution climatology as a reference. The monthiy GISST2.2 fields for
1982 onwards are based on a blend of <I>in situ</I> and satellite SST anomalies
on 2&deg; x 2&deg; spatial resolution, again with the G1SST2.0 1&deg; x
1&deg; spatial resolution climatology as a reference. During the creation
of GISST2.2 we developed improvements in the treatment of sea-ice and of
sea-ice zone SSTs, as described in Section A2.2 of Appendix 2.  

<P>Following these improvements, we averaged the GISST2.2 monthly fields
to form the GISST2.2 1961-1990 monthly climatology of SST and sea-ice.
From the SST climatology, we derived pentad normals of SST as described
in Appendix 4, and daily norrnals by linear interpolation.  

<P>The new monthly, pentad and daily SST climatologies have values throughout
the ice-zone areas (Appendix 2). A companion file contains the monthly
climatological sea-ice concentrations in tenths. The ice indicators are
zero wherever GISST2.2 has no ice in a 1&deg; area in the 30-year period,
and 10 wherever GISST2.2 has complete ice cover throughout this period.
A single occurrence of ice in GISST2.2 resulted in an indicator of 1, and
a single occasion of incomplete ice cover in a record of otherwise unbroken
ice in GISST2.2 yielded an indicator of 9.  

<P><B>3. ASSESSMENT OF NEW CLIMATOLOGY</B> 

<P>Figures la, b show the GISST2.2 SST climatology for January and July;
differences from the Bottomley <I>et al</I>. climatology are shown in Figures
1c, d and display changes exceeding 1 &deg;C over the Southern Ocean, as
well as smaller but real worldwide differences owing to the change of reference
period, e.g. a cooling in the northwest Atlantic (see Parker <I>et al</I>.,
1994) and the midlatitude north Pacific (Trenberth and Hurrell, 1994).
The improvement in the area 55&deg; - 65&deg; S, 90&deg; - 120&deg; W in
the Southern Ocean is demonstrated by Figure 2. MOHSST5 anomalies from
the Bottomley <I>et al</I>. (1990) 1951-1980 climatology are positive in
almost evely season with data in the reference period, and throughout the
historical record. MOHSST6 anomalies relative to both the GlSST 2.0 climatology
(Figure 2a) and the GISST2.2 climatology (Figure 2b) are much less biased.
They still show more frequent positive than negative SST anomalies in 1961-1990,
but this is because there were more missing seasons (plotted as zero) in
the earlier part of the reference period, when negative anomalies were
more common in the available observations. Anomalies in a reference period
are in general likely to have a non-zero average when they are based on
intermittent, patchy data, but if <I>virtually all</I> the anomalies are
of one sign, then the climatology must be biased. We conclude that the
new climatology is the more reliable and will allow a better assessment
of climatic variations in the Southern Ocean.  

<P>The new climatology resolves sharp gradients of SST better than do our
older climatologies. This is particularly evident in the Gulf Stream and
Kuroshio regions, and in some coastal upwelling areas. To illustrate this,
we compare in Figure 3 the GISST2.0 and GISST2.2 January climatologies
with a provisional earlier version in which the input <I>in situ</I> SSTs
were derived by adding 5&deg; resolution SST anomalies to the background
field, and the blending was carried out by solving Laplace's equation on
the sphere, much as was done by Bottomley <I>et al</I>. (1990). The GISST2.0
climatology in particular has stronger gradients in the aforementioned
areas than the provisional climatology. Changes between ihe GISST2.0 and
GISST2.2 climatologies near the Gulf Stream, in data-sparse seas such as
the Caspian, and in summer and autumn in the Arctic (Figure 4), are probably
a result of the more explicit use of satellite SST data for 1982-1990 in
GISST2.2, and the random exclusion of variance from the SST anomalies by
the eigenvector reconstruction for the earlier years of GISST2.2. The main
systematic change between the GISST2.0 and GISST2.2 climatologies was a
warming of the order of 0.5&deg;C in parts of the Antarctic ice zones as
a result of the revised treatment of sea-ice and marginal ice zone sea
surface temperatures in GISST2.2 (Figure 4).  

<P>Figures 5a to 5c show the GISST2.2 SST climatology for each calendar
month. Figures 6a to 6d show the sea-ice climatology.  

<P>A new optimum-interpolation-based climatology has been created by Reynolds
and Smith (1995), and resolves sharp gradients very well. However, while
its reference period is 1950-1979 between about 40&deg;S- and 60&deg;N,
it is effectively 1982-1993 at higher latitudes, with sea-ice data limited
to this period. So it is not exactly comparable with ours. In addition,
Reynolds and Smith (1995) did not develop a scheme for estimating marginal
ice zone SSTs from sea-ice concentrations, or include a climatology of
sea-ice concentration. Figure 7 illustrates the substantial differences
between the Reynolds and Smith (1995) and GISST2.2 climatologies for July
in the Atlantic sector of the Arctic.  

<P><B>4. CONCLUSIONS</B> 

<P>The GISST2.2 SST climatology is expected to be a much improved basis
for the assessment of climatic anomalies and the detection of climatic
changes, as well as for quality control. Figures 8a to 8c show smoothed
hemispheric and global SST anomalies derived from MOHSST6 relative to the
GISST2.2 1961-1990 climatology, and from a version of MOHSST5 relative
to the GlSSTl 1951-1980 climatology but with the <I>time series adjusted
to have zero mean in 1961-1990.</I> The removal of the cold biases from
the climatology for the Southern Ocean has significantly lowered the Southern
Hemisphere and global anomalies for the earlier years when coverage of
data at high southern latitudes was greater than in recent years (Figure
2 and Bottomley <I>et al</I>., 1990).  

<P>We have already used the GISST2.0 SST climatology as preliminary guidance
in the development of an improved night marine air temperature climatology
and a climatology of air sea temperature difference, both of which will
be important in model validation.

<P>Specification of SST within the ice pack and in marginal ice zones in
the GISST2.0 and GISST2.2 climatologies  

<P><B>A2.1 GISST2.0 CLIMATOLOGY</B> 

<P>Monthly <I>in situ</I> SST superobs for 1961-1990 in 1&deg; areas with
non-zero sea-ice concentration were related statistically to monthly concentric
5&deg; area sea-ice concentrations 1 using quadratic least-squares regressions
of the form:  

<P>SST = al<SUP>2</SUP> + bl + c (A2.1)  

<P>with the constraint that when I = 1.0 (i.e. complete ice cover), SST
= -1.8&deg;C.  

<P>a) Northern Hemisphere.  

<P>We used sea-ice concentration data from a new analysis by J.Walsh (pers.
comm.) except for five peripheral regions (Caspian Sea, Sea of Japan, Sea
of Okhotsk) where the data were the same as in GISST1.1 (Parker <I>et al</I>.,
1995).  

<P>For each season (January to March, etc.), separate relationships were
developed for overlapping 300 longitude bands 0&deg; - 30&deg;E, 1&deg;
- 31&deg;E,.... to avoid discontinuities in SSTs specified using them.
Temperatures were then specified in all 1&deg; areas having non-zero sea-ice
concentration using the relationship (A2.1) for the longitude band centred
on the target 1&deg; area for the appropriate season and the sea-ice concentration
in the same 1&deg; areas in the individual month, e.g. January 1949.  

<P>b) Southern Hemisphere.  

<P>We used the same sea-ice data as in GISST1.1, i.e. an ice/no ice classification,
except that the data for 1984-1988 had been in error and were replaced
by sea-ice concentrations obtained from NOAA. We did not use Advanced Very
High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) satellite SSTs, or convert ice-edges
into concentration gradients, as was done in the creation of GISST2.2 (Rayner
<I>et al</I>., 1995) which was used to create the GISST2.2 climatology
(see Section A2.2 below).  

<P>Owing to sparsity of <I>in situ</I> SST data near the Antarctic sea-ice,
relationships based on Arctic data were used to specify SSTs for 1984-1988.
Four relationships were developed, using monthly data irrespective of longitude
for January to March, April to June etc. The relationships were applied
to the Antarctic sea-ice data for the corresponding season, e.g the January
to March Arctic relationship was used in July to September in the Antarctic.
Again, temperatures were specified in all 1&deg; areas having non-zero
sea-ice concentration, using the sea-ice concentration in the same 1&deg;
area.  

<P>For 1961-1983 and 1989-1990, 1&deg; areas classified as sea-ice were
accorded a temperature of -1.8&deg;C. A possible future improvement is
to use relationships of the form of (A2.1) with NOAA sea ice concentrations
for the entire period from 1978 (R.Grumbine, pers.comm.), if they are deemed
to be homogeneous.  

<P><B>A2.2 GISST2.2 CLIMATOLOGY</B> 

<P>During the creation of GISST2.2 we developed improvements in the treatment
of sea-ice and of sea-ice zone SSTs, over and above those described in
Section A2.1. These improvements are described by Rayner <I>et al</I>.
(1995). For the 1961-1990 period:  

<P>i) We converted monthly Antarctic ice / no ice boundaries outside 1984-1988
to concentration gradients. Using GISST1.1 ice edge positions, 1&deg; x
1&deg; areas designated as purely sea-ice were assigned an initial concentration
of 10/10: sea boxes were initially assigned 0/10. Then, for each 1&deg;
x 1&deg; area, the average was calculated of the sea-ice concentration
assigned to it and those of the surrounding 8 1&deg; x 1&deg; areas. This
gave smooth gradients of sea-ice concentration, with concentrations of
5/10 at the GISST1.1 ice-edge. These concentrations were then used to create
the SST values in the marginal ice zones.  

<P>ii) We used monthly Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)
satellite SSTs for 1982-1994, along with observed sea-ice concentrations
for 1984-1988 and concentrations derived as in i) otherwise, to develop
the seasonal regressions for the Antarctic. The regressions were developed
for the Antarctic as a whole. They were applied in the same season for
which they were derived.  

<P><B>APPENDlX 3 </B> 

<P>Filling and smoothing the individual monthly temperature fields.  

<P><B>A3.1 GENERAL PROCEDURE FOR FILLING AND SMOOTHING</B> 

<P>i) 1&deg; areas at the edge of the Antarctic land mass were set to -1.8&deg;C
in the background field to ensure that anomalies could be interpolated
southwards whenever there was no sea-ice by which to ascribe a temperature
(Appendix 2) at the southern edge of the analysis.  

<P>ii) The background field was extended over land as described in Section
A3.3 below. This was not strictly necessary, since it was the anomalies
which were to undergo global interpolation (see iv) below). However, global
fields of actual 'SST' were found to be useful for some checking purposes,
and e.g. for contour plotting near islands and complex coastlines.  

<P>iii) The collated 1&deg; area monthly SSTs (Section 2 of main text)
were converted to anomalies relative to the background field.  

<P>iv) Missing 1&deg; area anomalies were then filled by linear interpolation
of the collated anomalies. The interpolation was done in four directions:
and the results from the four directions averaged.  

<P>v) The now complete field of anomalies was smoothed twice, each time
by replacing each value by the mean of its 8 neighbours as input to the
smoothing step.  

<P>vi) The extended background field was added to the smoothed anomaly
field, yielding a global field of SSTs.  

<P>The basic procedure of linearly interpolating the SST anomalies, and
then adding the background field to the result, preserves the second derivative
of the background field in the final analysis, as shown in Section A3.2
below.  

<P><B>A3.2 Proof that linear interpolation of observed anomalies is equivalent
to preserving the second derivative of the background field.</B>  

<P>Let 'normal' or background field temperatures at linearly adjacent positions
i, i+l,... be:  

<P>N<SUB>i</SUB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;N<SUB>i+1</SUB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; N<SUB>i+2</SUB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;N<SUB>i+3</SUB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.....
 

<P>First differences are then:  

<P>(N<SUB>i</SUB>-N<SUB>i+1</SUB>)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (N<SUB>i+1</SUB>-N<SUB>i+2</SUB>)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(N<SUB>i+2</SUB>-N<SUB>i+3</SUB>)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.....  

<P>and second differences are:  

<P>(N<SUB>i</SUB>-N<SUB>i+1</SUB>)-(N<SUB>i+1</SUB>-N<SUB>i+2</SUB>) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(N<SUB>i+1</SUB>-N<SUB>i+2</SUB>)-(N<SUB>i+2</SUB>-N<SUB>i+3</SUB>) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 

<P>and second differences are:  

<P>so that the second difference at location i+l is:  

<P>N<SUB>i</SUB> - 2N<SUB>i+1</SUB> + N<SUB>i+2</SUB> 

<P>For actual temperatures ('normals' or background field plus anomalies):
 

<P>N<SUB>i</SUB>+<IMG SRC="symbols/delta.gif" HEIGHT=11 WIDTH=5><SUB>i</SUB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
N<SUB>i+1</SUB>+<IMG SRC="symbols/delta.gif" HEIGHT=11 WIDTH=5><SUB>i+1</SUB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
N<SUB>i+2</SUB>+<IMG SRC="symbols/delta.gif" HEIGHT=11 WIDTH=5><SUB>i+2</SUB>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
..... 

<P>First differences are:  

<P>(N<SUB>i</SUB>+<IMG SRC="symbols/delta.gif" HEIGHT=11 WIDTH=5><SUB>i</SUB>)
- (N<SUB>i+1</SUB>+<IMG SRC="symbols/delta.gif" HEIGHT=11 WIDTH=5><SUB>i+1</SUB>)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(N<SUB>i+1</SUB>+<IMG SRC="symbols/delta.gif" HEIGHT=11 WIDTH=5><SUB>i+1</SUB>)
- (N<SUB>i+2</SUB>+<IMG SRC="symbols/delta.gif" HEIGHT=11 WIDTH=5><SUB>i+2</SUB>)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
..... 

<P>Second differences are:  

<P>(N<SUB>i</SUB>+<IMG SRC="symbols/delta.gif" HEIGHT=11 WIDTH=5><SUB>i</SUB>)
- (N<SUB>i+1</SUB>+<IMG SRC="symbols/delta.gif" HEIGHT=11 WIDTH=5><SUB>i+1</SUB>)
- [(N<SUB>i+1</SUB>+<IMG SRC="symbols/delta.gif" HEIGHT=11 WIDTH=5><SUB>i+1</SUB>)
- (N<SUB>i+2</SUB>+<IMG SRC="symbols/delta.gif" HEIGHT=11 WIDTH=5><SUB>i+2</SUB>)]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<P>So the second difference at location i+l is:  

<P>N<SUB>i</SUB> - 2N<SUB>i+1</SUB>+<IMG SRC="symbols/delta.gif" HEIGHT=11 WIDTH=5><SUB>i+1</SUB>
+ N<SUB>i+2</SUB> + <IMG SRC="symbols/delta.gif" HEIGHT=11 WIDTH=5><SUB>i</SUB>
- 2<IMG SRC="symbols/delta.gif" HEIGHT=11 WIDTH=5><SUB>i+1</SUB> + <IMG
SRC="symbols/delta.gif" HEIGHT=11 WIDTH=5><SUB>i+2</SUB> 

<P>If the second difference of the actual temperature at location i+l is
constrained to equal the second difference of the 'normal' or background
field at the same location:  

<P>N<SUB>i</SUB> - 2N<SUB>i+1</SUB> + N<SUB>i+2</SUB> = N<SUB>i</SUB> -
2N<SUB>i+1</SUB>+<IMG SRC="symbols/delta.gif" HEIGHT=11 WIDTH=5><SUB>i+1</SUB>
+ N<SUB>i+2</SUB> + <IMG SRC="symbols/delta.gif" HEIGHT=11 WIDTH=5><SUB>i</SUB>
- 2<IMG SRC="symbols/delta.gif" HEIGHT=11 WIDTH=5><SUB>i+1</SUB> + <IMG
SRC="symbols/delta.gif" HEIGHT=11 WIDTH=5><SUB>i+2</SUB>
 

<P>so that 

<P><IMG SRC="symbols/delta.gif" HEIGHT=11 WIDTH=5><SUB>i+1</SUB> = (<IMG SRC="symbols/delta.gif" HEIGHT=11 WIDTH=5><SUB>i</SUB>
+ <IMG SRC="symbols/delta.gif" HEIGHT=11 WIDTH=5><SUB>i+2</SUB>)/2  

<P>So, to map the second derivative of the 'normal' or background field
onto the actual temperature field, the temperature anomaly should be the
mean of the adjacent anomalies. In other words, linear interpolation should
be used.  

<P><B>A3.3 Extension of the background field over land and other missing
areas. </B> 

<P>1&deg; areas without values were filled with interpolated values. There
were 5 steps: 

<P>i) All 1&deg; areas without a background value and adjacent to at least
one 1&deg; area with a value were allocated the mean of the adjacent (up
to 8) 1&deg;0 area background values.  

<P>ii) Step i) was repeated.  

<P>iii) Rows of 1&deg; areas still without background values were assigned
values by east-west linear interpolation.  

<P>iv) Columns of 1&deg; areas without background values after step ii)
were assigned values by northsouth linear interpolation.  

<P>v) The results of interpolation in steps iii) and iv) were averaged
and the results used to fill the array where steps i) and ii) had not supplied
background values.

<P>Harmonic synthesis of monthly climatology.  

<P>The monthly climatological SSTs (T<SUB>m</SUB> m=1,12) for each 1&deg;

<P>(A4.3) <IMG SRC="figures/equa43.gif" HEIGHT=75 WIDTH=250 ALIGN=BOTTOM>  

<P>In the expressions for a, and b, the summations are divided by 6, not
