This page is intended to provide details and links to further information on validation for the HIRDLS instrument.
<p>
The HIRDLS instrument was launched on the NASA EOS Aura spacecraft on 15th July 2004. During
initial operation it was discovered that part of the instrument field of view was partially obstructed.
 As a consequence, the atmospheric measurements
produced are anomalous. The HIRDLS project team however, have developed new calibration schemes to
convert the anomalous measurements to equivalent standard radiance measurements as would have been
produced by a normally functioning instrument.


<p>Validation studies on HIRDLS data are currently being carried out at a number of institutes including, in the UK, 
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.ssd.rl.ac.uk/hirdls/default.htm">Department of Space Science and Technology, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL)</a>
<li> <a href="http://www.atm.ox.ac.uk/hirdls/home.htm">Department of Physics in the sub-department of Atmospheric, Oceanic and Planetary Physics (AOPP), 
University of Oxford</a>
</ul>
and, in the US,
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/">University of Colorado at Boulder (UCB)</a>
<li> <a href="http://www.ncar.ucar.edu/"> National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)</a>
</ul>
<p>General information on validation activities for the Aura mission may be found at the 
<a href="http://avdc.gsfc.nasa.gov">Aura Validation Center web site </a> including an

 given at the AURA Science team meeting in the Hague, November 2005. 

<p>The <a href="http://www.ssd.rl.ac.uk/rsg/">Remote Sensing Group at RAL</a> is validating level 1 data (calibrated and geolocated radiances) and level 2 data
 (geophysical atmospheric profiles) using sonde measurements and meteorological analyses. The work focuses on 
temperature, ozone and water vapour radiances and products and is on-going.
