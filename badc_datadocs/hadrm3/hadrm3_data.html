This dataset contains output from the HadRM3P variant of the MOHC Regional Climate Model (HadRM3), run from 1950-2099. Some of these climate change experiments were carried out by the Met Office Hadley Centre for the  2002 UK Climate Projections report.</p>

This dataset also contains data used for  the 2009 UK Climate Projections (UKCP) project. These are referred to as HadRM3-PPE-UK. In this case the data corresponding to the UK domain have been extracted from the original (larger) domain, and it is these data which are made available here. The data is provided at daily resolution.</P>
<p>More information is available on the <a href="ensemble_members.html">ensemble members</a>, <a href="variables.html">variables</a>, <a href="grids.html">grids</a>, <a href="csv_format.html">CSV format</a>  and <a href="structure.html">archive structure</a> relating to the <a href="../hadrm3-ppe-uk/index.html">HadRM3-PPE-UK </a>dataset. </P>
<p>
These data have been made available via the <a href="http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/data/link">Climate Impacts LINK Project</a>, a Defra-funded activity operated by the British Atmospheric Data Centre, which allows access for research to a range of data from model experiments undertaken at MOHC. It should be noted that data accessed via LINK is provided "as-is", and users seeking more detailed guidance should refer to the relevant <a href="http://www.ukcip.org.uk/">UK Climate Projections</a> report.
