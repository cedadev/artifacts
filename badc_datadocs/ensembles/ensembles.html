Introduction</H2>

<P>The BADC holds simulation data from the Hadley Centre's HadGEM1 model. Participants in the EU ENSEMBLES Project can obtain access to this data, in CF-NetCDF format, through the BADC.</P>

<P>Details about the HadGEM1 datasets are provided on the <A HREF="/data/hadgem1">HadGEM1 web pages</A>.

Access to data</H2>

<P>The BADC holds many of the full output datasets from the HadGEM1 experiments in the Met Office's pp-format. However, under ENSEMBLES, all users are required to access the data via the <A HREF="http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/help/software/dx/">BADC Data Extractor</A> web-interface that allows sub-setting in space, time, variable selection and output to CF-NetCDF format. For very large extraction requests you may be required to contact the BADC directly.<br>
<P>Access to this view of the HadGEM1 datasets is restricted to ENSEMBLES participants that have registered with the BADC and completed a successful application for access. Once you have registered with the BADC you should <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dataset_registration/dataset_info.cgi.pl?datasetid=ensembles">apply
for access</A>. The online application process includes agreement of the Met Office Conditions of Use. Subject to eligibility you will be granted access within 1 day of receipt and will receive a confirmation email.</P>
