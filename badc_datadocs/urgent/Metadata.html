<p><h2><a name="What">1. What are metadata? Why are they essential?</a></h2>

<p>
The term <i>metadata</i> encompasses all the information necessary to interpret,
understand and use a given dataset.
<i>Discovery metadata</i> more particularly apply to information (keywords)
that can be used to identify and locate the data that meet the user's
requirements (<i>via</i> a Web browser, a Web based catalogue, etc).
<i>Detailed metadata</i> include the additional information necessary for a
user to work with the data without reference back to the data provider.
The metadata required by the NASA Ames Standard Format include both discovery
and detailed metadata.
</p><p>
Metadata pertaining to observational data, for example, include details about
how (with which instrument or technique), when and where the data have been
collected, by whom (including affiliation and contact address or telephone
number) and in the framework of which research project.
In the case of processed data, the nature of the initial raw data and the
derivation process must be stated.
The nature and units of the recorded variables are of course essential, as well
as the grid or the reference system.
Metadata pertaining to model output should include the name of the model, the
conditions of the calculation, the nature of its output, the geographical
domain over which the output is defined (when applicable), etc.
Specific conditions applying to the model or the experiment may be mentioned.
Metadata also obviously include information on the format in which the data are
stored, the order of the variables, etc, to allow potential users to read them.
Metadata pertaining to software models include the key points of the theory on
which the model is based, the techniques and computational language used,
references, etc.
</p><p>
Since the evaluation of information relevance may widely vary with individuals,
some metadata standards have been &#150; and are still currently being &#150;
developed with the aim of uniformising metadata presentation.
The other advantage of metadata standards is that they ensure the transmission
of the information contained in the metadata (and hence the ability to use the
data), in some predefined generic way, to remote and future users, provided
that the latter will know the adopted conventions.
Which in turn requires the existence, maintenance and transmission of manuals
describing the set of conventions relevant to a particular metadata standard
&#150; some kind of <i>metametadata</i>.
</p><p>
Since a crucial section of the metadata pertains to the data format, different
metadata standards have been developed in conjunction with the various data
formats.
Existing data format standards, and metadata standards alike, are based both on
the specific needs of confined scientific communities and on habits already in
use within these communities.
All of them regularly undergo updates and are susceptible of further evolution.
In geosciences and among disciplines where 2-dimensional Earth surface reference
systems play an important role (like arch&aelig;ology), the most popular
data formats seem to belong to the
<a href="http://www.gistandards.org.uk/">GIS</a>
family (<i>Geographic Information Systems</i>).
In the atmospheric research community, however, the <i>NASA Ames Format for
Data Exchange</i> has been widely adopted since it is both simpler and more
generic (in particular, it is better adapted to 3-D and 4-D fields).
In addition, it makes provision of simplified cases fitted to data
collected onboard balloons or aircrafts.
It also includes rules applying to the formulation of metadata.

<p><h2><a name="Addi">3. Additional documentation</a>
</h2>

Any additional documentation on recorded data or images, whether pertaining to
a single data file or a whole dataset, that would not find its place into the
structures described above (because it does not fall into any described category
or because it is too voluminous) may be submitted to BADC in the form of a text
file that will be stored in the URGENT archive documentation directory.
These documents may for example include technique description, possible use of
the data, study conclusions, etc.
