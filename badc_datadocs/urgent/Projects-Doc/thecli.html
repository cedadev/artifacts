<h2><a name="Proj">1. Project overview</h2>

This study, conducted in collaboration with the Met Office Open Road Service and
with the seven Metropolitan Borough Councils of the West Midlands, developed a
new Road Weather Information System (RWIS) for the West Midlands County, with
the purpose of improving the techniques used to decide when to salt roads.
A particular emphasis was put on the nature of the difference between urban and
rural road temperatures.
Among the achievements of the project, a climate based Geographical Information
System (GIS) for the West Midlands was constructed and a map of climate zones
for the West Midlands was produced.
New sky-view factor mapping techniques were developed as part of the project.

<h2><a name="Coll">3. Data collection</h2>
Field measurement of sky-view factors using a digital video camera.
Data from weather stations were provided in confidentiality by local
authorities.
Data are not publicly available and are not hosted at BADC.

<h2><a name="Data">4. Summary of available results</h2>
The Geographical Information System (GIS) developed by the project is recorded
on a CD-ROM (not available yet).
Its reading requires Arc-View.
