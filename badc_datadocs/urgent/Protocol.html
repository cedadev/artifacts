<h1>URGENT Data Protocol</h1>
<hr>
<p>The aims of the Data Protocol are
<ul>
 <li>to ease dissemination of scientific results within the URGENT community;
 <li>to protect the rights of the individual scientists funded by URGENT;
 <li>to have all the involved researchers treated equitably;
 <li>to ensure the quality of the URGENT data archive.
</ul>

<p>
Although these aims may conflict at times, it is hoped that the provisions
of the protocol resolve these conflicts fairly.
It is recognised that this cannot always be achieved to everyone's complete
satisfaction: 
there are bound to be cases where individual interests clash with those of
the URGENT programme as a whole.
Therefore, to try to meet these aims, all scientists involved in the URGENT
programme are required to abide by the following conditions.

<ol>
<li>All scientists involved in URGENT are to have equal and complete access
    to measurements and model results produced during URGENT.
<li>Data must be made available to other URGENT scientists as soon as possible,
    <i>via</i> the designated data centres.
    Any corrections or amendments to data already archived at a designated data
    centre should be submitted as soon as possible.
<li>To allow data validation, access to data and model results will be
    restricted to URGENT participants for a period of time ending one year
    after the completion date of the corresponding project.
    After the validation period, the data will be released to the public
    domain.
<li>It is each researcher's responsibility to ensure that the data used in
    his/her publications are the best available at that time. 
<li>If measurements or model results from other research groups within URGENT
    are used in a publication, joint authorship must be offered.
    (This does not necessarily have to be accepted, particularly in cases
    where due credit and acknowledgement can be given in other possibly more
    appropriate ways).
<li>Whilst the data are restricted from the public domain, each researcher has
    the right to refuse to allow his/her work, whether measurement or
    calculation, to be used in a publication or presentation prior to the
    researcher's own publication of that work. 
<li>Whilst the data are restricted from the public domain, they should not be
    transferred to a third party (<i>i.e.</i> a non URGENT participant) without
    the originator's consent.
<li>Data and metadata should conform to the standards laid out in the documents
    <i>URGENT Programme Metadata Requirements and GIS Harmonisation
    Standards</i> and <i>URGENT Data Management Plan</i>. 
    These documents are available from the URGENT Web site 
    (<a href="http://urgent.nerc.ac.uk/"
    target="_top">http://urgent.nerc.ac.uk/</a>).
    For <i>Air Science</i> projects, data and metadata formats should comply
    with the NASA Ames standard specifications as described in the BADC
    documentation on that subject
    (<a href="/data/urgent/Format.html">http://www.badc.rl.ac.uk/data/urgent/Format.html</a>).
<li>In the event of a dispute the final decision rests with the URGENT Steering
    Committee.
