<h1>
QUEST Theme 3: The implications of global environmental changes for the sustainable use of resources
</h1>

<hr>
Human
activities depend on marketed and non-marketed "services" provided by the terrestrial and marine
biosphere. There is an urgent need to understand the responses of ecosystem services to a changing
environment and to quantify the implications of such changes for human activities in a globally consistent
way. Typical issues for QUEST therefore include:<ul>
<li>The consequences of a changing climate for global patterns of freshwater availability, taking into
account potential changes in demand.
<li>The consequences of a changing environment for global patterns of agriculture and forestry,
taking into account economic drivers and their response to changes in supply.
<li>The degree of threat posed to global biodiversity by a rapidly changing climate, and the potential
effectiveness of strategies to mitigate the loss of biodiversity due to changes in climate and land
use.
<li>The potential efficacy and cost-effectiveness of measures designed to mitigate global climate
change through terrestrial and marine ecosystem management.
</ul>
