Introduction
</h2>
<p>

Agriculture Forestry an Other Land Use (AFOLU), specifically forestry, has been identified as an instrument that could be used for project-based flexibility mechanism under the Kyoto Protocol of the UNFCCC. The JI (Joint Implementation) mechanism is available to AFOLU but has not been investigated substantially to date. JIFor proposes to use projects in Russia and Romania (specifically countries with economies in transition) to investigate the policy, verification and methodological issues and social, environmental and hydrological concerns of these AFOLU project types in a "hands on", practical approach.
<P>
This research project, with accompanying demonstrator project (JI), will provide the first scientific basis for forestry based climate mitigation projects.  It will investigate four different demonstrator project types:
<UL>
    <LI>Afforestation/reforestation
    <LI>Biomass energy production
    <LI>Forest conservation
    <LI>Forest management
</UL>
Its focus is on carbon, but it will address indicators of socio-economic impacts, other measures (biodiversity, water). A key output will be Kyoto-compliant operational documents.

Who to contact
</h2>
JIFor is led by Dr Robert Matthews (Forest Research) with 18 co-investigators from Joanneum, Forest Research, TUV SUD, GfA Envest, Forest Research Romania, WWF Russia, Climate Community and Biodiversity Alliance.

<P>
Each QUEST project will have a designated "data co-ordinator" to ensure good communication with the QUEST core team/BADC regarding data issues, and to ensure that each project meets its data provision obligations. The data co-ordinator for the JIFor project is to be determined.
