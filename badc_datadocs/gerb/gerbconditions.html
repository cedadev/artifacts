<strong><em>The GERB data policy shown below applies to all GERB data. Please note that the BADC only
holds released edition data and not NRT or pre-release products.</strong></em>

<H1>GERB Data Policy</H1>

<H2>Aims</H2>

<p>The aims of the data policy are as follows:


<ul>
<li>

To ensure the timely scientific exploitation of GERB data, once these data 
are judged by the Principal Investigator as fit for that purpose; 
</li>

<li>

To ensure that users of the GERB data are kept informed about the 
appropriate use of the GERB products;
</li>

<li>

To ensure that all released Edition GERB data are adequately validated, 
and the characteristics well documented; 
</li>

<li>

To ensure appropriate exploitation of the GERB near-real time products;
</li>

<li>

To ensure that only scientists closely concerned with, and therefore 
knowledgeable about, the validation of GERB data should use pre-release 
GERB data in publications; 
</li>

</ul>
</p>


<H2>Definitions</H2>

<p>
Three categories of GERB data are discussed in this document, these are 
"Edition" GERB products, "Near-real time" ("NRT") GERB products and 
"pre-release" GERB products. Definitions are given below.
</p>

<ul>

<li>

Data released to the public from the GERB archive will be labelled as 
<b>"Edition" data</b>: these will be validated products, with an assessment 
of quality and documentation to support their pedigree.  Data is only 
considered part of the "Edition" data set if it is both included in 
the climate archive and bears the name Edition (denoted by "EDnn" in the 
product filename, e.g. "ED01" for Edition 1). 
</li>

<li>

Products available from RMIB that are processed with the same version of 
the software as released products are considered <b>Near Real Time (NRT) 
products</b> until they have passed quality assurance and been included 
in the Edition archive as part of the Edition dataset.
</li>

<li>

All products processed with versions of the software for which there are 
no corresponding Edition products are considered <b>pre-release GERB data.</b> 
</li>

<li>

Edition data may be used for scientific study, but users are required to 
first read the data quality summary and ensure the data is suitable for 
their purpose.
</li>

<li>

Near real time (NRT) and pre-release versions of GERB products should 
be treated as un-validated products provided without assurance of quality 
or consistency
</li>

<li>

NRT GERB products may be used with caution for scientific studies if no 
suitable Edition product is available, but the user should bear in mind 
that their validation is ongoing and they may be of reduced accuracy 
compared to the Edition GERB products.
</li>

<li>

Pre-release GERB products are not suitable for scientific exploitation 
and should only be used by GERB science team members and associated 
scientists in the context of validation studies.
</li>

<li>

Users should refer to the data distribution websites to determine 
which GERB product versions have corresponding Edition products and can 
therefore be considered NRT products.
</li>

</ul>


<H2>Data Policy</H2>

<p>
<b>Anyone wishing to use GERB data for any reason should first register for 
data access.</b> This registration should be made even if data has been obtained 
from some other source, this will ensure that the use of the data are 
appropriate and enable the GERB project to keep all users informed of 
any relevant findings or changes to the data.
</p>

<p>
Registrations to access GERB data at the BADC will automatically be forwarded 
to the GERB team.
<!--To register for access to the released Edition GERB data, users should contact 
<a href="mailto:gerb@imperial.ac.uk">gerb@imperial.ac.uk.</a> -->
For access to the near real time GERB products users should go to 
<a href="https://gerb.oma.be/mailman/listinfo/rolss/">
https://gerb.oma.be/mailman/listinfo/rolss/.</a>
</p>

<p>
All GERB data may be used solely for the purpose for which they were 
supplied. They may not be used by any other projects or researchers unless 
these have obtained permission to do so by registering for data access.  
Please note that this applies even for other bona fide academic work. 
</p>

<p>
Data sets must not be passed on to third parties under any circumstances. 
Any scientist requiring data that happens to have been supplied already to 
someone else, even within the same institute or program of research, must 
first register for data access. It is the responsibility of registered 
users to ensure that any subsequent use of the data downloaded for a 
specified project is registered. 
</p>

<p>
<b>All publications resulting from the use of any GERB data should clearly 
state the data product used and reference Harries et al. (2005).</b> 
It is requested that authors acknowledge the GERB project in their 
publication and forward electronic copies of papers accepted for 
publication to the GERB project teams at Imperial and RMIB.
</p>

<p>
<b>"Edition" GERB data products are released data that have undergone 
validation.</b>  Every attempt will have been made to ensure consistency of 
processing within a given edition. <b>These data may be used quantitatively 
for approved scientific studies by scientists who have registered for 
access to the GERB data.</b>  It is the responsibility of users of released 
Edition GERB data to read the associated quality summary and determine 
if the products are suitable for the intended studies.
</p>

<p>
<b>All GERB products not bearing Edition in their name or appearing in the 
Edition archive are near-real time or pre-release versions of the GERB 
data.  These should be considered un-validated products provided without 
assurance of quality or consistency.</b>  However, once a near-real time 
product has passed quality assurance and been included as part of the 
Edition dataset it may be considered as Edition data.
</p>

<p>
<b>Near-real time products may be used with caution for scientific studies 
if they are produced with a software version for which there are 
corresponding "Edition" GERB products.</b>  However, the user is advised 
that the validation of these products is ongoing, and that the quality 
indicators applied to the Edition products are not necessarily relevant 
to the near-real time products.  <b>Any work using these data should 
clearly state that 'near real time GERB products which may be of reduced 
accuracy compared to Edition GERB data' are being used</b> and should note 
the version number and product type.  These data may be presented in 
conference papers by any registered user of the GERB data if it is 
made clear that NRT GERB data are used.  NRT data should only be 
included in peer-reviewed publication if the existing Edition data 
are not adequate for the study, and it must be clearly stated in the
publication that near real time GERB data which may be of reduced 
accuracy compared to Edition GERB products are used.  Users are advised 
to clarify with the GERB project team that their use of the near real 
time products is appropriate before submitting studies making use of 
these data for peer review.  
</p>

<p>
<b>All GERB products produced with versions of the software for which 
there are no Edition products are considered pre-release data. </b> 
Such data are <b>not approved for quantitative scientific study</b> and are 
intended only, for example, for instrument monitoring and data 
validation. These data may be presented by GIST members and 
collaborating scientists in conference papers but it should be 
made clear in any presentation referring to these products that 
pre-release data were used. <b>Studies involving pre-release data 
products should only be included in peer reviewed papers dealing 
with their validation, and approval for their inclusion should 
first be obtained from the GERB Principal Investigator.</b> 
Such publications should make it clear that the data used were 
pre-release un-validated versions. Such studies should be carried 
out in collaboration with the GERB science team and proper 
acknowledgement should be given to the GERB project.
</p>

<p>
No warranty is given or implied regarding the suitability of these data for 
purposes intended by the recipient, and no liability is accepted for any loss, 
damage, claim, demand, cost or expense directly or indirectly arising from any 
use, receipt or supply of data under this agreement.
