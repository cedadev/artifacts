From 1972 to 2001 the Meteorological Research Flight (MRF) operated a C-130 aircraft which was comprehensively equipped to
make a wide variety of atmospheric observations. As can be seen from its appearance, it had been heavily modified for this
role and was one of the most sophisticated 'flying laboratories' for atmospheric research in the world.
The long striped probe on the nose allows sensitive instruments to make measurements, for example of turbulence, in a region
outside the influence of the aircraft itself; it also gives the aircraft its nickname of 'Snoopy'.
