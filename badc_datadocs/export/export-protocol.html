<HR ALIGN=LEFT>

The aims of the Data Protocol are:
<UL><br>
<LI> to encourage rapid dissemination of scientific results from EXPORT.
<LI> to protect the rights of the individual scientists funded by
EXPORT.
<LI> to have all the involved researchers treated equitably.
<LI> to ensure the quality of the data in the EXPORT data archive.
</UL>
<p>
These aims conflict at times, and it is hoped that the provisions of the
protocol resolve these conflicts fairly. It is recognised that this
cannot
always be achieved to everyone's complete satisfaction; there are bound
to
be cases where individual interests clash with those of the EXPORT
project. Therefore to try to meet these aims, all PIs involved in
EXPORT,
in accordance with and on behalf of their co-investigators, must
agree to abide by the following conditions:<p>
<OL>
 <LI> Preliminary data must be made available to other EXPORT scientists
     as soon as possible. There are 2 advantages to quick release a)
     planning of the future phases of the project can be greatly
improved,
     and b) scientific evaluation of the data can occur in a timely
manner.
 <LI> Any corrections or amendments to the preliminary data should be
     announced as soon as possible.
 <LI> Validated data must be made available to other EXPORT scientists
     via the BADC within 6 months of creation. The NERC/UKMO funded data
           will then be made available to the public domain 2 years
after
its                          collection.
 <LI> Results of model studies using data acquired during EXPORT must be
     made available to other EXPORT scientists via the BADC. The time
     scale for submission is the same as that for validated data, as
     outlined in point 3.
 <LI> Data submitted to the BADC must be in the data format agreed
between
     EXPORT PIs and the BADC. All agreed metadata describing the data
     must also be supplied.
 <LI> It is each PI's responsibility to ensure that the data used in
     publications are the best available at that time.
 <LI> All scientists involved in EXPORT are to have equal and complete
     access to measurements and model results produced during EXPORT.
 <LI> If measurements or model results from other research groups within
     EXPORT are used in a publication, joint authorship must be
     offered. This does not necessarily have to be accepted,
particularly
     in cases where due credit and acknowledgement can be given in
other,
     possibly more appropriate, ways.
 <LI> Whilst the data is restricted from the public domain (see point 3),
     each PI has the right to refuse to allow his/her work, whether
     measurement or calculation, to be used in a publication or
     presentation prior to the PI's own publication of that work.
 <LI> Whilst the data is restricted from the public domain (see point 3),
no
     data should be transferred to a third party without the originator's
     consent.
