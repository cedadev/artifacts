<H1>Description</H1>

<P>This document outlines the unix directory structure used at
the BADC for the EXPORT data archive. The structure reflects conventions
adopted by the BADC for other data archives, which are based on
ease of navigation and access. 

<P>All aircraft data collected as part of the EXPORT campaign
can be found under the directory <KBD>/badc/export/data</KBD>. 

<P>This directory is split in to a number of subdirectories based
on the aircraft on which measurements where made. Trajectories
calculated by the University of Reading can be found in <KBD><A
HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/ecmwf-trj/data/export">/badc/ecmwf-trj/data/export</A></KBD> 

<P>The subdirectory structure of <KBD>/badc/export/doc</KBD> and
<KBD>/badc/export/software</KBD> is not yet defined. These will
become defined as the need demands.
