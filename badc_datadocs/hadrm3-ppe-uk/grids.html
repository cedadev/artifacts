<p>The HadRM3-PPE-UK data is located on the regional model grid. This is a rotated-pole grid, where the North Pole is re-located. Due the nature of the model there are two different rotated grids used for different variables. The <a href="variables.html">variables</a> page refers to these grids as <b>RG1</b> and <b>RG2</b>. These names are arbitrarily used to differentiate between the two grids.</p>

<p>Each grid is fully described in its own page with related images and supplementary files:</p>
<ul>

    <li><a href="RG2">RG2 grid description</a></li>
