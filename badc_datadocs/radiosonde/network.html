<H2><A NAME="stations"></A>1. UK Upper Air Stations</H2>

<P>The UK Upper Air Network currently consists of twelve stations,
the locations of which are shown below.

WIDTH="428" HEIGHT="583" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></CENTER>

<P>The <A NAME="operational"></A><B><EM>operational</EM></B> stations
are part of the UK synoptic network. These stations perform a
6 hourly operational routine. Data is reported at 00, 06, 12,
18 GMT.

<P>The <A NAME="range"></A><B><EM>range</EM></B> stations do not
form part of the UK synoptic network. They are located at particular
army ranges. Ascents are performed at irregular intervals when
upper air information is required for range activities.

<H2><A NAME="changes"></A>2. Changes to the Upper Air Network</H2>

<P>It should be noted that during the period from 1991 to the
present day, there have been several changes to the upper air
network.

<UL>
  <LI>Shanwell (03170) closed on 15/3/92. The 6 hourly operational
  routine was transferred to Boulmer (03240) on 16/3/92.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Crawley (03774) closed on 30/9/92. It was replaced by Herstmonceux
  (03882) which opened on 1/10/92.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>West Freugh (03130) opened on 2/8/93.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Aughton (03322) closed on 31/3/96. The 6 hourly operational
  routine was transferred to Aberporth (03502).
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="highres"></A>3. High Resolution Data Stations</H2>

<P>Certain stations maintain their own records of high resolution
radiosonde data. The BADC currently is archiving high resolution
data from about 10 stations in UK, with data from the 1990's.

<P><STRONG>Aberporth:</STRONG><BR>
Data Coverage: From April 1990<BR>
Aberporth, located on the west coast of Wales, near Aberystwyth,
is a <B><EM>range</EM></B> station. Prior to the closure of Aughton
on 31/3/96, the station released radiosondes according to the
data requirements of range activities. On 1/4/96, the 6 hourly
operational routine of Aughton was transferred to Aberporth. Although
not part of the UK synoptic network, the station is now considered
<B><EM>operational</EM></B> as ascents are conducted four times
daily.

<P>The Aberporth high resolution data are used in association
with the <A HREF="/data/mst/">MST radar</A> data.

<P><STRONG>Boulmer:</STRONG><BR>
Data Coverage: From March 1992

<P><STRONG>Camborne:</STRONG><BR>
Data Coverage: From April 1990

<P><STRONG>Lerwick:</STRONG><BR>
Data Coverage: From November 1990
