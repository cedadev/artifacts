<H1>The Polluted Troposphere file-naming convention</H1>

<HR ALIGN=LEFT>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>The <a href="/data/polluted-tropo/">Polluted Troposphere</a> instruments and facilities produce a range of meteorological and 
chemical measurements of interest to the scientific community. From the point of view of data access, it is highly desirable to 
adhere to common file formats and file-naming conventions for all the data produced under Polluted Troposphere projects. This document outlines 
a file-naming convention agreed between the Polluted Troposphere Principal Investigators and the BADC. A well thought out and organised file-naming 
convention allows quick data access and avoids the user having to read the file in order to enquire as to its contents. Using this 
convention will save time and resources when setting up data management for each individual project, it will also allow greater 
analysis and manipulation of the data by software at the BADC (and beyond). 

<H2>The Polluted Troposphere file-naming convention</H2>
The Polluted Troposphere file-naming convention uses long file names since these indicate significant information about the contents 
of the file without having to read the file or refer to the directory structure. Important attributes in a file name include 
INSTRUMENT, LOCATION and TIME.

<P>The chosen convention is as follows:<P>

<font size="+2">
<center><kbd><b>instrument_location_YYYYMMDD[hh][mm][ss][_extra].ext</b></kbd></center></font>

<P>Where:
<P>
<kbd><font size="+2"><b>instrument</b></kbd></font> - is the instrument name (full or shortened) or model name. When the same instrument is used by 
a number of groups, the instrument name should be prefixed with the institute name/code and a hyphen, for example <b>uea-ptrms</b> 
and <b>york-ptrms</b>. See <a href="/data/polluted-tropo/common_names.html#instruments">current list</a>.
<p><font size="+2"><kbd><b>location</b></kbd></font> - is the location name (full or shortened). This refers to the location of the 
observation and not the institute or location of the participating scientist/group. This field could be used for a range of items 
such as a site, a station, a platform, an institute or a university. See <a href="/data/polluted-tropo/common_names.html#locations">current list</a>.
<p><font size="+2"><kbd><b>YYYYMMDD</b></kbd></font> - is the date on which measurements were taken.
If a data file spans more than one day then this field should represent the first day during which data was recorded. The year is given 
as four digits with month and day as two digits each.
<p><font size="+2"><kbd><b>[hh][mm][ss]</b></kbd></font> - is the time of day specified (optional). Hours, minutes and seconds can be 
represented as two digits each. Hours can be used alone, only hours and minutes used or all three fields can be included. However, 
minutes or seconds cannot be used without the preceding time unit (i.e. no minute field allowed unit without the hour field).
<p><font size="+2"><kbd><b>[_extra]</b></kbd></font> - this section allows additional code to define such things as different range 
resolutions and so forth. It could also be used for Version numbers etc,.
<p><font size="+2"><kbd><b>.ext</b></kbd></font> - will normally be .nc (NetCDF) or .na (NASA Ames) although occasionally other formats 
will be used, in particular .png and .gif for Image files. See 
<a href="/data/polluted-tropo/common_names.html#extensions">current list</a>.

<P>Filenames should contain only the characters <font size="+2"><kbd><b>[-_.a-z0-9]</b></kbd></font>. 
Spaces are forbidden and upper case characters should be avoided. 
The underscore "<b>_</b>" character should only be used as a separator between fields.

<H2>File-naming for non-standard data (e.g. model, trajectory data)</H2>
Some Polluted Troposphere projects will also generate model data, flight data, data recorded at sea (stationery and in transit), 
trajectories and other non-standard data types. It is suggested that the above format be adapted in the following ways:

<OL>

<LI><B>Data recorded by onboard moving craft</B><BR>
When data is recorded on a moving craft the varying spatial location should not be recorded in the filename. Instead, the location 
field in the filename should include a name (or code) for the vessel and optionally the flight/voyage code/number.<P>

<LI><B>Trajectory data</B><BR>
Calculated trajectory data is similar to data recorded on a moving craft. The varying spatial location should not be recorded in the 
filename. Instead, the <kbd><b>location</b></kbd> field in the filename should include a relevant code for the trajectory 
type/model/number.<P>

<LI><B>Model data</B><BR>
In the case of the model data, the <kbd><b>instrument</b></kbd> field in the filename should instead be used for a model code 
(indicating the type, version etc., of the model). For box models running at one location only the <kbd><b>location</b></kbd> fie
ld should include this. However, models that output data over a grid can use appropriate codes to represent this.<P>

<LI><B>Use of the <kbd><b>[_extra]</b></kbd> additional information field</B><BR>
The <kbd><b>[_extra]</b></kbd> field is unlikely to be used in most cases but is provided as an option for exceptional cases where the 
data producer wishes to include some additional information not otherwise catered for. Suitable warning should be used a
gainst overloading this field. Such a use might be in forecast files where the date and time provide the start time whilst the 
<kbd><b>[_extra]</b></kbd> field provides the time of the actual forecast.<P>

<LI><B>Use of the <kbd><b>[hh][mm][ss]</b></kbd> time options</B><BR>
The <kbd><b>[hh][mm][ss]</b></kbd>  options are included or occasions where data is produced at such a high frequency that storing it 
in multiple files per day, hour or minute becomes appropriate. This is unlikely to be commonplace but is available for special cases.<P>

<LI><B>Image files</B><BR>
Text files (<kbd><b>.txt</b></kbd>) may be included to describe image data. Apart from the file name extension (last field), files 
containing images and their associated metadata should have the same name.
When data exist both in the form of NASA Ames formatted fields and images,files also have the same name, except for the file name 
extension.
</OL>

<H2>Standardising common names in the naming convention</B><BR></H2>
In order to standardise the names used within the file-naming convention the BADC will need to collate those currently used by the 
community and publish them via our website. This can be regularly extended to include new locations, instruments, models etc
,. Interaction with Polluted Troposphere scientists will be essential to achieve this aim successfully. Please see the 
<a href="/data/polluted-tropo/common_names.html">common names in filenames</a> page to see the current list.<P>
