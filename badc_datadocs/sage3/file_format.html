<H2>1 - Level 1B Solar Transmission Product</H2>

The Level 1B Transmission product contains the SAGE III atmospheric slant path transmission 
profiles at 85 spectral channels. The profiles are skewed vertically and extend from sea level 
to an altitude of 100 km in 0.5 km intervals. These data have been geolocated and normalized 
against exoatmospheric solar measurements to produce slant path transmission profiles. 
The Level 1B product is only available for solar measurements.

<a name="L2_solar"></a>
<H2>2 - Level 2 Solar Species Product</H2>
The Level 2 Solar Species products are produced from the Level 1B Transmission profiles. 
The content of the Level 2 Solar Species organized by species, each including information 
on its relative uncertainty. Species are reported in profiles on a geometric altitude 
coordinate system with a vertical resolution of 0.5 km.
<P>
<b>Aerosol</b>
Profiles of aerosol extinction are provided at 9 different wavelengths (385, 448, 521, 596, 676, 
754, 868, 1019, and ~1550 nm) from the surface or opaque cloud top to an altitude of 40 km, where 
the contribution due to aerosols becomes negligible at all wavelengths.
<p>
In addition, two aerosol products are provided in this list: (1) Stratospheric aerosol optical 
depth and (2) the ratio of aerosol extinction to the contribution due to molecular scattering 
at a wavelength of 1019 nm.
<p>
<b>Water Vapor</b>
Profiles of water vapor are provided in units of concentration from the surface to an altitude 
of 50 km. A temperature profile retrieved from SAGE III measurements or from a gridded analysis 
will facilitate computation of relative humidity. The water vapor products are retrieved using 
a nonlinear least squares approach from the solar occultation measurements of slant path 
absorption.
<P>
<b>Nitrogen Dioxide</b>
Profiles of nitrogen dioxide are provided in units of concentration from the tropopause to an 
altitude of 50 km.
<P>
<b>Ozone</b>
Three different profiles of ozone are provided in units of concentration over the altitude 
range 6 to 85 km. One profile is based upon measurements made at short wavelengths in the 
Hartley-Huggins band and a second profile is based upon measurements made at visible wavelengths 
in the Chappius band. The third product consists of a composite profile constructed of data from 
the Chappius band at lower altitudes (below about 55 km) and from the Hartley-Huggins band at 
higher altitudes (above approximately 55 km). For each of the 3 different ozone products, slant 
path column density profiles are also included.
<p>
<b>Temperature and Pressure</b>
The retrieved profiles of temperature and pressure are new products provided by the SAGE III 
mission. Besides providing a valuable scientific measurement, this data will permit a 
self-consistent determination of molecular scattering along the limb view which is needed for 
accurate retrievals of ozone and other species.
<P>
<a name="L2_cloud"></a>
<H2>3 - Level 2 Cloud Product (from solar data)</H2>
The SAGE III instrument detects subvisible and opaque clouds by using measurements of aerosol 
extinction and their uncertainties at wavelengths of 525, 1020, and 1550 nm. The basic product 
consists of 3 vertical profiles extending from 0 to 30 km that contain information on the 
presence of clouds at 0.5 km intervals. Unlike all other Level 2 products, a granule of this 
product contains a collection of cloud data for one calendar month.
<P>
<a name="L2_lunar"></a>
<H2>4 - Level 2 Lunar Species Product</H2>
The retrieval of constituent profiles from irradiance measurements acquired during lunar 
occultation events is a new capability for the SAGE III experiment. These retrievals are 
more complex than those employed for solar events because they account for the spatial and 
spectral non-uniformity of the surface albedo of the moon and the much lower measurement signal. 
One important difference between the solar and lunar retrieval techniques is the absence of a 
Level 1B slant path transmission profile product for lunar occultation retrievals. This is a 
consequence of not being able to determine limbdarkening curves with sufficient accuracy to 
calibrate each SAGE III lunar occultation event.
<p>
A single scan vertical resolution of the lunar Level 2 products is 1 km. The chemical species 
concentration data from multiple scans are bin-averaged and reported on a geometric coordinate 
system with a vertical resolution of 0.5 km to maintain grid spacing compatibility with the 
solar Level 2 products.
<p>
<b>Chlorine Dioxide</b>
Profiles of chlorine dioxide are provided in units of concentration for an altitude range of 
15 - 25 km.
<p>
<b>Nitrogen Dioxide</b>
Profiles of nitrogen dioxide are provided in units of concentration from 20 to 50 km.
<p>
<b>Nitrogen Trioxide</b>
Profiles of nitrogen trioxide are provided in units of concentration for the altitude range 
of 20 - 55 km.
<p>
<b>Ozone</b>
Profiles of ozone based upon measurements made at visible wavelengths in the Chappius band 
are provided in units of concentration from 16 to 35 km.

<H2>6 - Dataset location</H2>

The SAGE III data are mirrored from NASA Langley DAAC in a predefined directory structure as follows:
<P> 
<blockquote> [shortname.versionid] / [acquisitiondate], where:
</blockquote>
[shortname.versionid] is the collection identifier. (e.g., g3alsp.002).
<br>[acquisitiondate] is the date the measurement was taken. (e.g., 2002.06.22).
<P> 
Data files in HDF-EOS format are stored in the appropriate directory
based on collection and acquisition date. Corresponding metadata files
in Extensible Markup Language (XML) format are also
stored in the appropriate directory. 
<P>
<b>NOTE:</b>  The SAGE III data was downloadded from the EOS Data Gateway, Langley
DAAC Data Pool and it should be noted that the version number on
that system represents the Earth Science Data Type version rather
than the SAGE III Data version. Accordingly, the newly-released V3
data is stored as version '002'.
