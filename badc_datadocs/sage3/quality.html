<H1>SAGE&nbsp;III Product Quality Summary - General Comments</H1>

<HR ALIGN=LEFT>
<p>
Three ozone profiles are available in this release of the solar products: a 
mesospheric ozone product and two Chappuis-based products using multiple-linear 
regression (MLR) and least-squares (LS) algorithms. The composite ozone profile 
included in the V2 data products has not been populated in this version in 
order to encourage feedback from users regarding the best way to combine the 
three existing ozone profiles.
<P>
To eliminate obvious noise in profile products, the slant path optical depth 
profiles have been smoothed to an effective vertical resolution of 1 km. The 
width of the smoothing kernel expands to 5 km when threshold slant path optical 
depth abundances fall below 0.005. Information on the altitude dependence of 
the smoothing kernel is provided in the bit flag array for each species.
<p>
Transmission measurements used in the retrieval of Chappuis-based ozone, NO2, 
and aerosol extinction at 449, 521, 601, and 675 nm are corrected for 
unanticipated etalon effects associated with the use of a silica-fused 
attenuator plate during solar occultation events. Aerosol extinction measured 
at 384 nm and at 676 nm and longer wavelengths have not been corrected for 
these etalon effects in this release.
<P>
Water vapor and temperature/pressure products are not included in the V3 data 
set.
<P>
Version 3 provides the first release of the SAGE III Cloud Data Product. This 
data contains information on the presence of clouds for each profile event. A 
reader routine is also available.
<P>
Lunar event data files contain profiles of ozone, NO2, and NO3. The OClO 
product algorithm is still under development.
<P>
Lunar event measurements are made when the moon's illumination is 40 % or 
greater, and the solar zenith angle at the observation tangent point is greater 
than 95 degrees. Data taken near these limits (illumination less than ~60 % 
and solar zenith angle less than ~105 degrees) may be subject to increased 
noise.
<P>
Altitude registration of lunar data is accomplished in part by comparison to a 
forward model of the oxygen A-band.
<P>
Due to orbital characteristics of the Meteor-3M platform, satellite sunrise 
events are always local sunsets. Satellite sunset events are local sunsets 
except between November and February when they are local sunrise events. 
The Earth-referenced event type is recorded in both the Level 1 and Level 2 
product data files.
