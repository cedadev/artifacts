<h1>ACSOE Data Protocol<BR CLEAR="ALL"></H1>

<P><HR ALIGN=LEFT>The aims of the Data Protocol are:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>to encourage rapid dissemination of scientific results from
  ACSOE;
  <LI>to protect the rights of the individual scientists;
  <LI>to have all the involved researchers treated equitably.
</UL>

<P>These aims conflict at times, and it is hoped that the provisions
of the protocol resolve these conflicts fairly. It is recognised
that this cannot always be achieved to everyone's complete satisfaction;
there are bound to be cases where individual interests clash with
those of the ACSOE mission. Therefore to try to meet these aims,
all PIs involved in ACSOE, in accordance with and on behalf of
their co-investigators, must agree to abide by the following conditions:</P>

<OL>
  <LI>Preliminary data must be made available to other ACSOE scientists
  as soon as possible. (There are 2 advantages to quick release:
  a) planning of the future phases of the mission can be greatly
  improved, and b) scientific evaluation of the data can occur
  in a timely manner).
  <LI>Any corrections or amendments to the preliminary data should
  be announced as soon as possible.
  <LI>Validated data must be made available to other ACSOE scientists
  via the BADC by the submission date stipulated for each experiment
  in the ACSOE Implementation Plan.
  <LI>Results of model studies using data acquired during ACSOE
  must be made available to other ACSOE scientists via BADC as
  soon as possible.
  <LI>It is each PI's responsibility to ensure that the data used
  in publications are the best available at that time.
  <LI>All scientists involved in ACSOE are to have equal and complete
  access to measurements and model results produced during ACSOE.
  <LI>If measurements or model results from other research groups
  within ACSOE are used in a publication, joint authorship must
  be offered. (This does not necessarily have to be accepted, particularly
  in cases where due credit and acknowledgement can be given in
  other, possibly more appropriate, ways).
  <LI>Whilst the data is restricted from the public domain (see
  ACSOE Implementation Plan), each PI has the right to refuse to
  allow his/her work, whether measurement or calculation, to be
  used in a publication or presentation prior to the PI's own publication
  of that work.
  <LI>Whilst the data is restricted from the public domain (see
  ACSOE Implementation Plan), no data should be transferred to
  a third party without the originator's consent.
  <LI>In the event of dispute the final decision rests with the
  ACSOE Scientific Steering Group.
</OL>
