<h1>A NASA-Ames file format checking program<br clear=all></h1>
<BR>
<HR>

<P>
The BADC FORTRAN program NACHECK was written specifically for
checking that the NASA-Ames format files,
submitted in connection with the NERC Special Programme, ACSOE,
were NASA-Ames and project compliant.

The current version of this program handles File Format Indices
of 1001, 1010, 2110 and 2160 only, although the logical
structure is such that it is relatively easy to modify the
program so that it can handle other formats.

It can also handle ACSOE files in which the first independent
variable is a colon-separated time code representing, hours, minutes, secs
etc. Note however that whilst the program can deal with the file headers for
these formats, the data tables themselves are not well handled.
<p>
You can
<a href="/cgi-bin/dataex_file.cgi.pl">run the NACHECK program</a> 
from your web browser to validate your files online.

</P>
<P>
The NASA-Ames file header structure is explained under
<A HREF="header.html">NASA-Ames</A>.
</P>

<H3>Main Program</H3>

<P>
The main program gets the file name and the directory from the command line,
and then calls subroutines
which read and interpret the components of the file header and
finally, read the data tables.
</P>


<H3>Subroutine OVERVIEW </H3>

<P>
The subroutine OVERVIEW extracts the number of header records (HEADRECS)
and the file format index (FFI) from the first record of a NASA-Ames
file and then reads to EOF counting the number of records (RECORDCNT)
This routine also prints record HEADRECS 
which should be compared with the known last record in the header.
</P>

<H3>Subroutine FIXEDHEAD </H3>

<P>
Subroutine FIXEDHEAD reads and prints the first seven records of a
NASA-Ames file - note that the meaning of each of these records
is the same for any NASA-Ames file.
</P>

<H3>Subroutine INDEPENDENT </H3>
	
<P>
Subroutine INDEPENDENT reads and prints the attributes of the independent
variable or variables from the NASA-Ames header
- the current program works with FFI values of 1001, 1010, 2110 and 2160.
</P>

<H3>Subroutine PRIMARY </H3>

<P>
Subroutine PRIMARY reads and prints the three attributes associated with
each of the the primary variables - these are the scale factor,
the default value substituted for missing data and the name of the variable.
</P>


<H3>Subroutine AUXILIARY </H3>

<P>
Subroutine AUXILIARY reads and prints the three attributes associated with
each of the the auxiliary variables.
For the case of real variables this is the scale factor, the default
value substituted for missing data and the name of the variable.
In the case of character variables the respective quantities are
number of characters in string, the default strings and the names of
the variables. 
</P>

<H3>Subroutine COMMENTS </H3>

<P>
Subroutine COMMENTS reads and prints special and normal comments held in the
file and annotates the print accordingly.
</P>

<H3>Subroutine TABLES </H3>

<P>
Subroutine TABLES reads and examines and prints the data tables. The
examination consists of attempting to read the correct number of
primary values from each table record.
If the wrong number are found - this happens for instance if a  primary
variable is missing or there are spurious characters in the record -
then an error will be reported.
</P>

<P>Please note this is a very basic routine - it does not, for example,
distinguish between records containing primary values and those
containing auxiliary ones and may flag an error 
when there is nothing wrong.
It does however correctly interpret colon-separated time codes
which is done by reading the table records into a buffer,
counting the number of colons and replacing each ":" by ",".
before the record is read the appropriate independent and
primary variable dimensions are worked out.  
Note that this feature cannot be supported on MS-DOS systems.
