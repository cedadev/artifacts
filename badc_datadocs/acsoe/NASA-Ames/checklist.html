<h1>(ACSOE) NASA-Ames file submission<br clear=all></h1>
<BR>

<HR>

<P>
Before you transfer a <A HREF="header.html"> NASA-Ames </A> format file to the 
central database
please spend a few minutes working through the checklist given below -
these few minutes could go a long way towards preventing your file from being
rejected by BADC because the 
<A HREF="ingest.html">file-ingestion </A> process
could not understand the name of the file or its contents.
</P>

<P>
At BADC we use a FORTRAN computer program called
<A HREF="program.html"> NACHECK </A>
to verify that files are NASA-Ames compliant.
You can get a copy of this program
(which is available as source code and as compiled versions for
DEC UNIX and MS-DOS)
from 
<EM><A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/acsoe/software/NASA-Ames_checking/">
/badc/acsoe/software/NASA-Ames_checking</A></EM>.

You can also <a href="/cgi-bin/dataex_file.cgi.pl">
run the NACHECK program</a> from your web browser to validate your files.

</P>

<P>
Before you submit a file you should check:
<P>
<OL>

<P><LI><STRONG>The file name is correct -
note all alpha characters must be in lower-case.</STRONG>
<BR>
Files must be submitted to the login.badc.rl.ac.uk directory 
<EM>/cache/acsoecache/nasaames</EM>.
Submission means either transferring the file from your home site using ftp or
copying a file from your personal account on login.badc.rl.ac.uk. 
<BR><EM>
(Remember the BADC scheme uses the name of the file
to compute which directory the file should be put in -
if the name is wrong, the system will not work)
</EM>

<P><LI>
<STRONG>The file is an ASCII one and includes a NASA-Ames 
<A HREF="header.html">file header</A></STRONG>

<P><LI><STRONG>The values for FFI, the file format index, and NLINES, the 
(header) line count, are correct.</STRONG>
<BR>
<EM> (Remember to count the the first line, which contains
FFI and NLINES, in the line count.) </EM>


<P><LI><STRONG>The descriptions of the independent, primary and
(if they are used) auxiliary variables have
been entered correctly. </STRONG>
<BR><EM>
(See the page on file header for further information.) </EM>

<P><LI><STRONG>Any "missing-data" values are well outside the
range of valid data values.</STRONG>
<BR><EM>
(Many applications work better if these are supplied as integers.)
</EM>


<P><LI><STRONG>If the first independent variable is time,
make sure the unit is the agreed ACSOE one of  "fractional julian day". </STRONG>
<BR><EM>
(Fractional julian day is generated by adding day number -
day 1 is January 1st -
to the fractional day, the latter expressed with an accuracy of six figures
eg 2.525706 translates to 12:37:01 on 2nd January.)
</EM>  


<P><LI><STRONG>All data tables are free of erroneous characters.</STRONG>
<BR><EM>
(These characters are found sometimes at the point where two data tables
have been joined together to form one, larger one.)
</EM>

<P><LI><STRONG>All data records have the correct number of primary variables.
</STRONG>
<BR><EM>(Many applications stop with an error condition if data values are 
missing).
</EM>

<P><LI><STRONG>The (data) start date and the file-creation date have been entered
correctly on line seven. </STRONG>
<BR>
<EM>(Please remember to update the version number and the creation date when 
you submit a revised version of an existing file.)</EM>.

<P><LI><STRONG>The keyword values: </STRONG> THIS-FILE-NAME, THIS-FILE-VERSION, 
THIS-FILE-ENDS and E-MAIL-CONTACT <STRONG> are included and correctly
completed. </STRONG>

<P><LI><STRONG>If you use ftp
please double-check that your software is set to ASCII-mode ftp.</STRONG>
</OL>
