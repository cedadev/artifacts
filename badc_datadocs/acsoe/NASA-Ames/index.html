<P>The concept of a NASA-Ames format file originated during the
1987 <A HREF="/data/step/">Stratosphere Troposphere Exchange Project
(STEP) </A>when it was decided to collect all the campaign data
on a single medium which could be accessed easily by all participants
during the campaign. For compatibility only ASCII characters were
allowed and every NASA-Ames file had to consist of a computer-readable
ASCII header followed immediately by one or more ASCII data tables.</P>

<P>The file header, which is written in computer and <EM>human</EM>
readable form, describes in full detail the properties of the
data that follow it such as the units and the scaling, the default
values substituted for missing data and the layout of the table
(or tables).</P>

<P>Although the NASA-Ames format has been adopted for several
campaigns, particularly those involving coordinated aircraft and
ground-based measurements, these notes are directed specifically
at participants in the ACSOE (Atmospheric Chemistry Studies in
the Oceanic Environment) special community programme of NERC.
Because of the wide spectrum of measurements being made during
this programme and the large number of experimenter groups involved,
using NASA-Ames data format holds significant advantages particularly
when it comes to early exchange of data. However, in spite of
the fact that these notes are intended primarily for ACSOE data
suppliers, all users of the format should be able to glean something
meaningful from them.</P>

<P>The ACSOE data files conform to the NASA-Ames standard, although
in addition, special keywords have been included in the header
to simplify the task of creating a file catalogue.</P>

<P>For a comprehensive description of NASA-Ames format see &quot;A
General Format for Data Exchange&quot; written by the format originators
Gaines and Hipskind and available in PostScript format from <EM>/badc/acsoe/doc</EM>.</P>
