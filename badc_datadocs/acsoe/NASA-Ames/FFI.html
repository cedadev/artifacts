<h1>NASA-Ames files - Interpreting the File Format Index<br clear=all></h1>
<BR><HR>

<P>
N.B. Almost all ACSOE files submitted to the BADC should fit into FFI 1001.<BR>
Some balloon sonde data from previous programmes have used FFI 2160.

<H2>1000 series</H2>

<UL>
<LI>1001 - one real unbounded independent variable. <BR>
No auxiliary variables.
<LI>1010 - one real unbounded independent variable. <BR>
Auxiliary variables are real.
<LI>1020 - one real unbounded independent variable with implied values
between the independent variable marks. <BR>
Auxiliary variables are real.
</UL>


<H2>2000 series</H2>

<UL>
<LI>2010 - two real independent variables, one unbounded and one
bounded with constant values. <BR>
Auxiliary variables are real.
<LI>2110 - two real independent variables, one unbounded and one
bounded with its values recorded in the data records. <BR>
The first auxiliary variable is the number of bounded independent variables, 
the remainder are real.
<li>2160 - 
two independent variables: one unbounded character variable and one real 
bounded one.<BR>
The first auxiliary variable is the number of bounded independent variables.
At least one of the auxiliary variables is a character string.
<LI>2310 - two real independent variables, one unbounded and one
bounded with its number of constant increment values, base value and increment
defined in the auxiliary variable list.<BR>
The first three auxiliary variables are the no. of const increments, base value
and increment described above; the other auxiliary values are real.

</UL>


<H2>3000 series</H2>

<UL>
<LI>3010 - three real independent variables, one unbounded and two bounded 
with constant values defined in the file header.<BR>
Auxiliary variables are real.
</UL>


<H2>4000 series</H2>

<UL>
<LI>4010 - four real independent variables, one unbounded and three bounded 
with constant values defined in the file header.<BR>
Auxiliary variables are real.
</UL>
