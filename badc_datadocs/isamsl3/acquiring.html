<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The ISAMS data was supplied to the BADC in VMS binary files.
To enable transfer of the data to a wide variety of machines we
have converted it into ASCII (plain text). To speed up transfer
of the ASCII files, we have compressed them using the GNU gzip
program.
<P>Therefore, you will need gzip installed on your local system to uncompress
the data files and software packages - the source code is available
from software archives. You will also need to know <A HREF="/help/howtogetdata_gzip_and_tar.html">how
to use gzip and tar</A> once you have the files on your system
and <A HREF="/help/ftp_guide.html">how to transfer files via FTP (File
Transfer Protocol)</A>

<P>The ASCII files are purely an intermediate form for data transfer.
We supply software to convert the ASCII files back into binaries
on your local machine, enabling you to use software that reads
the data files as binary. We also supply an example read program
to read the binary data, and 3rd party software written by other
users of the data, which we do not support.</P>

<P>Since the dataset is public, it is available anonymously by
FTP and can also be acquired through the WWW.</P>

<H3><A NAME="transfer"></A>2. Checking and Transferring Data from the BADC</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  
<P>All data and software is located beneath the directory <EM><A
  HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/isamsl3/">/badc/isamsl3</A></EM>. 
  Here you will find a README file and the following subdirectories 
  <UL>
    <LI><A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/isamsl3/data/">data</A>
    - contains the gzipped ASCII data files.
    <LI><A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/isamsl3/doc/">doc</A>
    - contains ISAMS documentation.
    <LI><A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/isamsl3/software/">software</A>
    - contains the ASCII conversion, example read and any 3rd party software available.
  </UL>
<P>Check whether the data you require is available by browsing the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/isamsl3/data/">ISAMS L3 
data</A> directories.

<H3><A NAME="convert"></A>3. Converting the data to binary on your machine</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4>3.1 Unzipping the files</H4>

<P>Unzipping the compressed ASCII files (using the <EM>gzip -d</EM>
command) will typically change the size from about 2-2.5 Mbytes
per file to around 10-15 Mbytes. Make sure you have sufficient
disk space before unzipping the files. Note that when you convert
the ascii file to a binary on your machine it will be substantially reduced in size.</P>

<H4>3.2 Building the software</H4>

<P>The ASCII to binary <a href="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/isamsl3/software/">conversion program - asc2bin</a> (and
the read example) is supplied in a gzipped tar archive, or as
individual source files. A makefile and README file are supplied
to help you build the code. The README file explains the small
changes required to adapt the code to suit your local operating
system.</P>

<H4>3.3 Running the software</H4>

<P>The <a href="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/isamsl3/software/">conversion program</a> will produce binary data files for your
machine. If you have problems, refer to the README file or contact
the BADC team. The resulting binary files are considerably smaller
than the intermediate ASCII files. Once the conversion is successfully
completed you can remove the ASCII files.</P>

<H3><A NAME="files"></A>4. Reading the data files</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4>4.1 The file structure</H4>

<P>There are 4 level 3A files for each ISAMS species per day -
one for each of the file classes 3AT, 3AL, 3TP, 3LP. The structure
of the files is outlined below, but users should refer to the
<A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/isamsl3/doc/isams_l3a.sfdu">level 3A file format</A>
document for more detailed information.</P>

<P>The level 3AT files are a time ordered sequence of records
each containing one profile, together with information on the
position of the profile. The associated parameter file contains
data on the operation conditions of ISAMS which are not allowed
by the level 3AT file definition. There is a one-to-one correspondence
between records in the 3AT and 3TP files.</P>

<P>The 3AL products have a similar structure, but in this case,
each record corresponds to a profile interpolated onto standard
4 deg. latitude intervals at positions defined by the intersection
of the tangent track with a latitude circle.</P>

<H4>4.2 The Access Routines</H4>

<P>A set of user-callable FORTRAN subroutines is available from
the BADC to read the original data files. These should compile
on most platforms with minor changes to the open statements.</P>

<H4>4.3 Third Party Software</H4>

<P>In the <a href="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/isamsl3/software/">software directories</a> for the ISAMS data, there is a
subdirectory for 3rd Party software. If you develop software to
use with the ISAMS data, then we encourage you to let us have
a copy so that we can make it available to other researchers.
