<H1>Status of the ECMWF Operational Archive at the BADC</H1>
<I>This page provides any information about changes made to the BADC archive of
ECMWF operational data.</I>

<HR ALIGN=LEFT>

<P>The BADC is extracts ECMWF <a href="/data/ecmwf-op/">Operational Analysis and Forecast data</a> on a daily basis to keep pace (with a slight delay) with production. By agreement with the ECMWF the BADC does not make Operational data available until 10 days after the forecast has been produced. 

<P>Table 1 lists changes that have been made to archive that may be of interest to users.<P>

   <TD>BADC begins extracting Operational data in the same format as the 
   <A HREF="/data/ecmwf-e40">ERA-40 Re-analysis</A> data for consistency. These data are in Spectral T159 (upper air) and N80 Reduced Gaussian Gridded (surface and some upper air parameters) resolutions. A full listing of the available products and the location of the data are provided on the
