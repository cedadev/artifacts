  <TITLE>ECMWF Re-Analysis and Operational Data from the BADC</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff">

<H1>
ERA and Operational analyses available from the
BADC <BR CLEAR="ALL"></H1>
<BR>
<P><HR ALIGN=LEFT> 

<P>The following data from the ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA) and Operational
datasets are archived at the BADC: 
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>Full resolution analysed data (initialised and uninitialised)
  <LI>Reduced resolution analysed data - i.e. data interpolated
  onto a lat.-long. grid
  <LI>Forecast data
  <LI>Averaged data
</UL>

<P>Note that uninitialised data are not available for the Operational
dataset due to changes in the ECMWF model. More complete details
of each of these data types are given below. 

<H2>Full Resolution Analysed Data</H2>

<P>The following data are archived at 6 hourly intervals (0000,
0600, 1200, 1800 hrs) in both the ERA and Op. datasets. These
fields are archived in both initialised and uninitialised form
for the ERA data. The Operational analyses from the current 3D-variational
assimilation system are practically equivalent to the initialised
analyses from the previous Optimum-Interpolation system used in
ERA. 

<P>Note that where data is held on a Gaussian N80 grid, in the
ERA dataset the grid is reduced gaussian, whereas in the Operational
data the grid is a full gaussian grid. 

<P><DL>
  <DT><STRONG>Spectral upper-air data at T106</STRONG>
  <DD>These fields are available on 31 model levels, or on standard
  pressure levels (1000, 925, 850, 775, 700, 600, 500, 400, 300,
  250, 200, 150, 100, 70, 50, 30, 10 hPa). Data fields common to
 both are temperature, vertical velocity, relative vorticity, divergence
<BR>
  * Pressure-level data also includes relative humidity and geopotential.<BR>
  * Model-level data also includes the single level field ln(surface
  pressure) and specific humidity. Spec. hum. values are stored
  on a Gaussian N80 grid, except for the period 3rd March 1994
  - 4th April 1995 when they are stored in spectral form.
 <P> <DT><STRONG>Surface data on a Gaussian N80 grid</STRONG>
  <DD>surface temperature and wetness at soil levels 1-4, snow
  depth, mean sea level pressure, 10 metre u,v, 2 metre temperature
  and dewpoint, surface roughness, albedo, skin reservoir content,
  percentage of vegetation, apparent surface humidity, log. surface
  roughness length for heat, skin temperature.
 <P> <DT><STRONG>Constants</STRONG>
  <DD>surface geopotential (orography) plus standard deviation
  of orography, anisotropy of subgrid scale orography, angle of
  subgrid scale orography, slope of subgrid scale orography, land/sea
  mask.
</DL>

<H2>Reduced Resolution Analysed Data</H2>

<P>A reduced resolution dataset at 2.5&deg; resolution will
also be generated by ECMWF. Due to constraints on storage space
the BADC will not archive the full range of dates, but will support
a subset of these data, consisting of data every 6 hours from
1st Jan 1991. This dataset contains: 
<P>
<DL>
  <DT><STRONG>Data on standard pressure levels (see above)</STRONG>
  <DD>geopotential, temperature, specific humidity, u- wind, v-wind,
  vertical velocity, relative humidity.
 <P> <DT><STRONG>Surface data</STRONG>
  <DD>temperature and soil wetness at soil levels 1-4, snow depth,
  mean sea level pressure, 10 metre u and v, 2 metre temperature
  and dewpoint, surface roughness, albedo, skin reservoir content,
  percentage of vegetation, apparent surface humidity, log. surface
  roughness length for heat, skin temperature.
 <P> <DT><STRONG>Constants</STRONG>
  <DD>surface geopotential (orography) plus standard deviation
  of orography, anisotropy of subgrid scale orography, angle of
  subgrid scale orography, slope of subgrid scale orography, land/sea
  mask.

<H2>Forecasts</H2>

<P>Some fields of interest are not analysed directly but are available
from the forecast model. These data are on the Gaussian N80 grid
and standard pressure levels. 

<P>24 hour forecasts are made twice per day at 0000 and 1200 hrs
for 1979 - present. These forecasts enable the accumulation of
hydrology, energy and momentum flux fields at the surface and
top of the atmosphere. The quantities are accumulated over the
latter part of the forecast to avoid problems with the model in
the earlier times. Units are kg/m<sup>2</sup> for hydrology, W/m<sup>2</sup> for energy
and N/m<sup>2</sup> for stresses. 
<P>
<DL>
  <DT><STRONG>Forecast data</STRONG>
  <DD>large scale precipitation (including snowfall), convective
  precipitation (including convective snowfall), surface sensible
  heat flux, surface latent heat flux, total cloud cover, surface
  solar radiation, surface thermal radiation, top solar radiation,
  top thermal radiation, u-stress, v-stress, latitudinal gravity
  wave stress, meridional gravity wave stress.
</DL>

<H2>Averaged Data</H2>

<P>(Note: at present, none of these data have been extracted from
ECMWF archives and the BADC is not in a position to confirm the
accuracy of the information below). 

<P>These are all based on the 2.5&deg; grid on pressure levels.
Averages, variances and covariances will be made available by
ECMWF for the analyses, 6 hour and 24 hour forecasts for the period
1979 - present. The following averages are proposed: monthly averages,
zonal averages, global averages, monthly / zonal averages, global
/ monthly averages.
