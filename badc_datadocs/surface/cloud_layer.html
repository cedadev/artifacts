The columns from CB1 to CB4 are used to report a number of different layers or masses of cloud.
The number of columns/groups shall in the absence of Cumulonimbus clouds not exceed 3.
Cumulonimbus clouds, when observed, shall always be reported, so that the total number of 
groups used can be four.
<p>
The selection of layers (masses) to be reported shall be made in accordance with the following criteria:
<ul>
<li>(a) - The lowest individual layer (mass) of any amount 
<li>(b) - The next higher individual layer (mass) the amount of which is greater than 2 oktas
<li>(c) - The next higher individual layer (mass) the amount of which is greater than 4 oktas
<li>(d) - Cumulonimbus clouds, whenever observed and not reported under (a), (b) and (c) above by means of a group referring exclusively to Cb.
</ul>
<p>
The order of reporting the groups shall always be from lower to higher levels.
<P>
In determining the cloud amounts to be reported for individual layers or masses 
in the 8-group, the observer shall estimate, by taking into consideration the 
evolution of the sky, the cloud amounts of each layer or mass at the different 
levels, as if no other clouds existed.

<P>This information is required from land stations and fixed ship stations, mainly in the tropics.
