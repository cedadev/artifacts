<strong><FONT COLOR="#FB0000"><Strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong></FONT> The information provided below solely refers to the Met Office Land Surface data (1900-2000) dataset which has been superseded by the <a href="http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/view/badc.nerc.ac.uk__ATOM__dataent_ukmo-midas">Met Office MIDAS dataset (1853-present)</a> at the BADC.

The <em><a href="/cgi-bin/data_browser/ukmofetch.cgi.pl" target="_TOP">Download Met Office station data</a></em> page allows you to download selected Met Office 
surface station data to your computer <strong>(please note this service is only available to registered users who have been granted access to the Met Office Land Surface data)</strong>. It is intended for downloading data from 
multiple UK stations. If you want to download all the data for a single station 
then this can be more easily achieved using the 
<a href="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser">Get Data</a> file browser.
<p>
You select the files that you want to download by specifying the following information:
<ul>
<li><a href="/data/surface/all_file_formats.html">File type</a>
<p>

<li><a href="/data/surface/met_domain.html">Message type</a>
<p>
<li><a name="year">Year.</a> 
This can be entered as <em>YYYY</em> to select a single year, 
<em>*</em>
 to select all years, or <em>YYY*</em> to select a decade.
<p>

<li>One or more UK regions. Multiple regions can be selected on a PC by using the
<em>Ctrl</em> key or the <em>Shift</em> key to select a range.
</ul>

<font color="red">
Note that selecting many regions or years will result in long download times 
and may result in failure to download. You are advised to select as few 
regions and years as possible for each download.
</font>
<p>
The <b>Action</b> option allows you
to either download the selected data or display information about the matching
files. If you select <em>Download</em> then a list of all matching files will
be constructed and displayed (this can take some time). When the page has finished
loading you need to scroll to the bottom and press <b>Continue</b> to begin the
download or <b>Cancel</b> to return you to the main form.
<p>
The files
will be downloaded to your computer as a single gzipped tar file. This file can
be unpacked by using 
<a href="http://www.winzip.com">WinZip</a> 

on PCs, or the
<a href="http://www.gzip.org">gzip</a> and tar utilities on unix machines.
Versions of gzip and tar (vmstar) are also available for 
<a href="http://www.openvms.compaq.com/freeware/freeware50/">openVMS machines</a>.
