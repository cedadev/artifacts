<H2>Summary of the Data Processing</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>These data are processed in several stages by the principal
  participating national and international agencies: NASA, NOAA,
  European Space Agency, Japan Meteorological Agency, Canadian
  Atmospheric Environment Service, Centre de Meteorologie Spatiale,
  and Colorado State University. The sources for these data are
  the NOAA Polar Orbiting Satellites, Geostationary Operational
  Environmental Satellites (GOES), Geostationary Meteorological
  Satellites (GMS), and METEOSAT weather satellites from which
  visible and thermal infrared radiances are collected and analyzed.
  Originally retrieved radiances are first sampled at 30 km and
  three-hourly resolution and normalized in calibration by reference
  to the NOAA-7 Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR).
  This data set is called the ISCCP Stage B3 (ISCCP-B3) data and
  has navigation and calibration information appended.</P>
  <P>These data are then merged and analyzed at 280 km resolution,
  maintaining the three-hourly temporal resolution to become the
  ISCCP Stage C1 (ISCCP-C1) data set. Data are available for the
  hours 00, 03, 06, 09, 12, 15, 18, and 21 UTC for the given months.
  The NAVY/NOAA Snow/Ice products and the TOVS data are included
  and make up a portion of the 132 variables contained in ISCCP-C1.</P>
  <P>The ISCCP-C1 products are then used to create the monthly
  statistics, at both three-hour-monthly and monthly temporal resolutions.
  The resulting products reside on this CD-ROM and are called the
  ISCCP-C2 data set. The variables include time and spatial means
  and standard deviations for cloud top pressure and temperature,
  cloud optical depth, and cloud water path. Optical depth, water
  path, cloud top pressure, cloud top temperature, and frequencies
  are available for low, middle, and high clouds and for cumulus,
  stratus, altocumulus, nimbostratus, cirrus, and deep convective
  clouds. Also offered as part of the C2 product are surface reflectance
  and snow/ice cover information. Variables derived from the TIROS
  Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) are precipitable water; surface,
  500 mb, tropopause, and stratospheric temperatures; and surface
  and tropopause pressures. Variables derived from visible wavelengths
  are available only during daylight hours.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
