  Temperature profiles at 9 layers; precipitable water at 5 layers;
  surface and tropopause temperature and pressure; and ozone. <BR>

  (cm); pressure in millibars (mb); ozone in Dobson Units. <BR>
<BR>
  1.3 Data Source.<BR>
<BR>
  The main data set used to produce a daily, global description
  of the ozone, temperature and humidity distributions is that
  obtained from the analysis of data from the TIROS Operational
  Vertical Sounder (TOVS) System, flown on the NOAA (National Oceanic
  and Atmospheric Administration) Operational Polar Orbiting Satellite
  series (Webowetzki, 1981). The TOVS system consists of three
  instruments (Kidwell, 1991): the High Resolution Infrared Radiation
  Sounder (HIRS/2), the Stratospheric Sounding Unit (SSU), and
  the Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU). The HIRS/2 is a 20 channel
  infrared spectrometer (along with one visible channel) that makes
  measurements in the vicinity of 3.7-4.6 micrometers (um), 6.7-11
  um and 13-15 um that are sensitive to atmospheric carbon dioxide,
  water vapor, ozone and the temperature structure of the troposphere.
  The SSU (supplied by the United Kingdom) is a pressure modulation
  spectrometer that makes three measurements at the same wavelength
  in the 15 um carbon dioxide band with different cell pressures
  to sense the temperature at about 1, 5, and 15 mb in the stratosphere.
  The MSU is a passive, scanning microwave spectrometer making
  measurements in four channels in the 5.5 um oxygen band that
  senses the temperature of the troposphere. <BR>
<BR>
  The measurements from the three instruments of the TOVS system
  are processed by NOAA to produce the TOVS Sounding Product. Contents
  of this product include: satellite identification, data and Earth-location
  of observation, solar zenith angle, land/sea indicator, surface
  (skin) temperature, estimated surface pressure, channels and
  method used for retrieval, 15 layer temperatures, 3 layer water
  abundances (precipitable water amount), tropopause temperature
  and pressure, ozone abundance, cloud cover and top pressure,
  and sounding radiances (Kidwell, 1991). <BR>

  1.4 Data Set Identification.<BR>
<BR>
  </P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP),
the first project of the World Climate Research Programme, is
organized to obtain global satellite observations of clouds for
research and to produce a cloud climatology covering a period
of at least twelve years. As part of the data analysis, information
concerning the temperature structure and water and ozone abundances
in the atmosphere are used in radiative model analyses of the
satellite radiance measurements to retrieve physical properties
of the surface and clouds (Schiffer and Rossow, 1985). Although
these data are available from the original sources covering a
longer time period, the versions used during the processing of
the satellite data are archived with the cloud climatology. <BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>2.1 Spatial Coverage. <BR>
<BR>
  The typical fraction of the globe covered by the TOVS Sounding
  Product, on a given day within a three hour interval, is 27%.
  Since the observations are so sparse, no attempt was made to
  retain information regarding the diurnal variability of temperature
  and humidity. However, tests of the variability of temperatures
  in the first layer show that the error associated with neglecting
  time-of-day is about 2-3 degrees K but is somewhat larger over
  land. The typical coverage of the globe obtained by collecting
  all observations from the same day, regardless of time of observation,
  is about 67%. <BR>
<BR>
  2.2 Spatial resolution. <BR>
<BR>
  The ISCCP version of the atmospheric data is interpolated to
  seven layers in the troposphere, defined by a specific surface
  and tropopause pressure at each location and time, and to two
  stratospheric temperature layers. The standard pressures defining
  these layers in the troposphere are 1000, 800, 680, 560, 440,
  310, 180, and 50 mb; the stratosphere layers are defined by the
  pressures 70, 30, and 5 mb. Thus, the layer mean temperatures
  and humidities represent values at the center pressures of these
  layers: 900, 740, 620, 500, 375, 245, 115, 50, and 15 mb. The
  surface and tropopause pressures actually define the extent of
  the lower and higher layers in the troposphere. For example,
  if the surface pressure is 900 mb, then the first layer extends
  from 800 to 900 mb with a center at 850 mb; if the tropopause
  pressure is 100 mb, then the seventh layer extends from 180 to
  100 mb with a center at 140 mb. The two stratosphere layers are
  fixed regardless of the location of the tropopause.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

  <P>4.1 Mission Objectives. <BR>
<BR>
  ISCCP focuses on the study of the distribution and variation
  of cloud radiative properties. Scientific objectives are as follows:<BR>
<BR>
  </P>
  <OL>
    <LI>To produce a global, reduced resolution, infrared and visible,
    calibrated and normalized radiance data set containing basic
    information on the radiative properties of the atmosphere from
    which cloud parameters can be derived. <BR>
<BR>
    <LI>To stimulate and coordinate basic research on techniques
    for inferring the physical properties of clouds from the condensed
    radiance data set, and to apply the resulting algorithms to derive
    and validate global cloud climatology for improving the parameterization
    of clouds in climate models. <BR>
<BR>
    <LI>To promote research using ISCCP data and contribute to improved
    understanding of the Earth's radiation budget (top of atmosphere
    and surface) and hydrological cycle. <BR>
<BR>
  </OL>
  <P>4.2 Key Satellite Flight Parameters. <BR>
<BR>
  The NOAA spacecraft are a series of satellites in 870 kilometer
  (km) (nominal), circular, near-polar, sun-synchronous orbits
  with an inclination angle of approximately 99 degrees (retrograde)
  to the equator. They cross the equator during local morning and
  afternoon (and corresponding night times), with an orbital period
  of approximately 102 minutes. Each sequential orbit covers adjacent
  longitudes near the equator and overlapping longitudes near the
  poles. Temperature sounding and ozone observations are made by
  the TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) and are used in
  the ISCCP analysis of B3 data. In addition, the Advanced Very
  High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) on board this series is composed
  of up to five spectral channels with a nadir resolution of 1.1
  km.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>5.1 Processing Steps and Data Sets.<BR>
<BR>
  The TOVS Sounding Product atmospheric data have a resolution
  of about 2.5 degrees latitude-longitude. The NOAA Geophysical
  Fluid Dynamic Laboratory (GFDL) data have a resolution of 2.5
  degrees latitude and 5 degrees longitude. The ozone climatology
  has a latitude resolution of 10 degrees. Since the ISCCP 2.5
  degree equivalent equal-area grid has lower resolution at higher
  latitudes than the TOVS Sounding Product, these data are mapped
  to the ISCCP grid by placing them into the cell which contains
  the coordinates of the sounding. Only one observation per cell
  per day is reported. If more than one observation is available,
  the one closest to the cell-center coordinates is used. The NOAA
  GFDL and ozone data, having lower resolutions than the ISCCP
  grid, are mapped such that all ISCCP grid cells with centers
  within the range of the original data grid cells are filled with
  same value. Original observations are indicated by an Origin
  Code value of 1. <BR>
<BR>
  To increase the coverage obtained on a single day, grid cells
  lacking an observation are filled from nearby values, as long
  as the topographic heights of the two locations differ by no
  more than one kilometer (actually, the difference is restricted
  to be &lt; or = 1005.84 meters = 3300 feet - the original units
  of the topography data set). Synthetic tests of this procedure
  were conducted to determine the error as a function of the distance
  over which the observation is moved. In data-dense regions, the
  observation at one location is compared to nearby observations.
  The error not only grows with increasing distance but grows more
  rapidly in the north-south direction than the east-west direction.
  Based on these results, missing values are filled by nearby observations
  that are within two grid cells to the east or west, i.e., within
  a distance of about 500 km. The typical error introduced is expected
  to be about 2-3 degrees K in temperature and less than 15% for
  precipitable water and 10% for ozone. With this replication,
  typical global coverage provided by daily observations is about
  85%. Values obtained by replication are indicated by an Origin
  Code value of 2. <BR>
<BR>
  Monthly mean values are formed from the daily TOVS data with
  spatial replications performed where needed. No value is reported
  if less than five observations are available during the month.
  The error produced by replacing a daily observation with the
  monthly mean value at the same location is about 3 degrees K
  for temperatures, 17% for water abundances, and 12% for ozone
  abundances. If no observation is available for a particular location
  and day and no observation is near enough on that day, then the
  monthly mean values for that location are used, if available.
  By filling with the monthly mean values, the daily global coverage
  is typically about 95%. Monthly mean values used for daily observations
  are indicated by an Origin Code value of 3. <BR>
<BR>
  If a TOVS monthly mean value is not available for a particular
  location, the ISCCP analysis uses two climatologies to fill in
  gaps in coverage. These data sets are the NOAA GFDL temperature/humidity
  climatology (Oort, 1983) and an ozone climatology from the NIMBUS-4
  BUV data (Hilsenrath and Schlesinger, 1981). Estimated errors
  are about 5 degrees K for temperatures, about 25% for water abundances,
  and about 15% for ozone abundances. Values obtained from the
  combined climatology are indicated by an Origin Code value of
  4. <BR>
<BR>
  The differences between the TOVS DAILY and MONTHLY layer-one
  water abundance show some significant departures from the monthly
  mean values. Further study of the distribution of these differences
  with latitude and season reveals a small population (about 2-4%)
  with values much larger than three standard deviations from the
  local monthly mean value. Other parameters in the data set did
  not exhibit this behaviour. These &quot;anomalous&quot; values
  were removed with the following procedure: (1) distributions
  of differences between daily and monthly mean, water abundance
  values for the first three layers in each grid cell are collected
  for eight latitude zones for each month, (2) a range of variations
  with respect to the monthly mean is determined by the width of
  these distributions defined by the plus and minus difference-values
  with 5% of the mode frequency (approximately equivalent to three
  standard deviations), (3) daily values outside the range defined
  by zonal difference distributions and local monthly mean are
  set equal to the nearest value within the range. Observations
  which have been changed in this way are indicated by an Origin
  Code value of 5. <BR>
<BR>
  The ISCCP atmospheric data are presented as daily, global maps.
  The data at a particular location and time are labeled by whether
  they represent an actual observation at that place and time (Origin
  Code = 1), nearby observation on the same day (Origin = 2), the
  TOVS monthly mean observations for that location and month (Origin
  Code = 3), or the climatological values for that month (Origin
  Code = 4). Although the typical amount of monthly mean or climatological
  data used is less than 5%, there are some occasions when fewer
  TOVS data are used. If data for a whole day are missing, for
  example, then the values found in the ISCCP data set for that
  day would be constructed from the TOVS monthly mean and climatological
  values. <BR>

<BR>
  5.4 Processing Changes.<BR>
<BR>
  This data set has been reprocessed. An error in mapping was found
  in an earlier version of TOVS atmospheric data delivered to the
  ISCCP Central Archive (ICA) that affects less than 1% of the
  grid cells. This error is only noticeable in those temperature
  values reported for layers with too high a pressure near the
  edge of high topography regions.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>6.1 Data Validation by Producer.<BR>
<BR>
  A publication describing the validation of the TOVS data at NOAA/NESDIS
  (Burdsall, 1991) prior to their use for ISCCP describes quality
  checking. During this validation all retrievals are checked to
  see if they are super-adiabatic. All super-adiabatic retrievals
  are marked as such and are not used for coefficient generation.
  A final check of the data is made by comparing it to the NMC
  analysis. If a substantial portion of an orbit is super-adiabatic
  and differs significantly from the NMC analysis, then the orbit
  is not distributed nor archived. <BR>
<BR>
  6.2 Confidence Level/Accuracy Judgment.<BR>
<BR>
  Certain errors are introduced as a result of the processing of
  the TOVS data. Since the observations are so sparse, no attempt
  was made to retain information regarding the diurnal variability,
  resulting in an error of 2-3 degrees K, with somewhat larger
  errors over land. The error introduced by replacing missing values
  by nearby observations (within 500 km) is about 2-3 degrees K
  in temperature, less than 15% in precipitable water and 10% for
  ozone. The error introduced by replacing daily observations by
  the monthly mean values is about 3 degrees K for temperature,
  17% for precipitable water and 12% for ozone. When the combined
  climatology data are used to replace the missing TOVS monthly
  mean value for a particular location, the error introduced is
  about 5 degrees K for temperature, 25% for precipitable water
  and 15% for ozone. <BR>
<BR>
  6.3 Usage Guidance.<BR>
<BR>
  The processing method used in each processing step in Item 5.1
  and corresponding error estimates are indicated by the Origin
  Code which is available for each map cell in the TOVS daily record
  file.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

  <P>Because the TOVS data set does not provide complete global
  coverage at all times, the final atmospheric data set constructed
  for use in the ISCCP analysis uses two climatologies to fill
  in gaps in coverage. These data sets are the NOAA GFDL temperature/humidity
  climatology (Oort, 1983) and an ozone climatology from the NIMBUS-4
  BUV data (Hilsenrath and Schlesinger, 1981).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
