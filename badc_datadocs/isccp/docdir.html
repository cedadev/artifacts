  <P>The <A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/CDs/isccpc2/document/">cd-rom document
  directory</A> holds the contents of the printed booklet which
  accompanies the CD-ROM and three descriptive catalogs for the
  ISCCP Stage C1 and C2 data, the ISCCP Snow/Ice Products, and
  the ISCCP TOVS data as standard ASCII files (go to the <A HREF="doc.html">indexed
  documentation</A> for more details).<BR>
<BR>
  However, please note that the only data on this disk are the
  ISCCP-C2 data, which are the monthly statistics, at both three-hour-monthly
  and monthly temporal resolutions. <BR>
  The ISCCP-B3, ISCCP-TOVS, ISCCP-Ice/Snow, and ISCCP-C1 data are
  available to NASA-funded researchers through NASA's Climate Data
  System, now part of Goddard's Distributed Active Archive Center
  (DAAC) or through the official ISCCP Central Archive: <BR>
