  <P>The third file in each yearly DATA subdirectory [e.g., (using
  DOS notation) \DATA\1984\] contains a READ Program, READPROG.FOR,
  which can be used directly by IBM mainframe users to read, decode,
  and re-map the files.<BR>
<BR>
  The <A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/CDs/isccpc2/software/">cd-rom software directory</A>
  holds <A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/CDs/isccpc2/software/isccp.for">FORTRAN
  source code</A> that has been modified to perform in the VMS
  and DOS environments. <BR>
  However, VAX users should obtain the code through ANONYMOUS FTP
  because of possible incompatibilities with the VMS file system.
  Check the ANON_DIR:[NCDS.ISCCP.VMS] subdirectory at nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov,
  128.183.36.23 (username: ANONYMOUS and password: GUEST). <BR>
  The disk can also be used on any UNIX platform, but the code
  must be modified. The software is designed to access the data
  as binary integers and convert them to physical quantities. <BR>
<BR>
  The producer-supplied program was modified to demonstrate the
  output of a sample file from the data set. The MS-DOS executable
  version of this sample program can be found in this directory
  as ISCCP.EXE. Type ISCCP to run the program. You will be prompted
  for an input file name [e.g., (DOS notation) \DATA\1984\FILE007.DAT].
  The executable was created with the Microsoft FORTRAN compiler.
  The code can be easily modified by a user to read all or any
  portion of the ISCCP-C2 data.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
