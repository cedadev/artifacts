A new batch of high resolution radiosonde data is now available from the BADC.
==============================================================================

The dataset now includes more recent data and data from extra stations. 
In particular 2 years of data from the Mount Pleasant (Falklands) site 
is included. Data from the Met Office autosonde sites will be made available 
as soon we have software to read it.
