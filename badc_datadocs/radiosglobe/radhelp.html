  <H3><A NAME="sonde"></A>1.1 The Radiosonde</H3>
  <P>A radiosonde is a small, lightweight package of instruments,
  suspended from a helium filled balloon (see <A HREF="figures/figone.html">figure
  1</A>). <BR>
  When the balloon is released, the apparatus rises through the
  atmosphere at approximately 5m/s. Measurements of pressure, temperature
  (and humidity for 1990-1998 European stations only) are taken
  at intervals during flight. Wind speed and direction can be determined
  from additional <A HREF="#wind">windfinding equipment</A>. Information
  is transmitted to the surface as a radio signal. The <A HREF="#ground">ground
  station equipment</A> receives the signal and processes the data.
<BR>
  The balloon bursts at a height of 20 to 30km and the radiosonde
  is returned safely to the surface by means of a small parachute.
  <H3><A NAME="type"></A>1.2 The Radiosonde type <U>used by the
  Met Office</U></H3>
  <P>The <A HREF="figures/rs80.html">RS80</A> radiosonde, manufactured
  by the Finnish company Vaisala, has been routinely used in the
  UK since 1981. Powered by a water activated battery, the instrument
  takes measurements at approximately 1.3 second intervals during
  the ascent. Pressure, temperature (and humidity) are measured
  using three capacitative sensors. A schematic diagram of the
  layout of the RS80 is shown in <A HREF="figures/figtwo.html">figure
  2</A>.
  <H4>(i) The Pressure Sensor</H4>
  <P>Atmospheric pressure is measured using the <A HREF="figures/figthree.html">&quot;Barocap&quot;
  pressure sensor</A>. This device is an aneroid capsule containing
  two capacitive transducer plates. The plates are secured to the
  steel alloy capsule membrane by supporting rods. The sensor is
  35.5mm in diameter and weighs 5g.
  <P>The aneroid capsule, shown schematically in <A HREF="figures/figthree.html">figure
  3</A>, expands or contracts as the air pressure changes. The
  flexible membrane moves the supporting rods, which in turn alter
  the separation of the capacitor plates. The capacitance across
  two parallel plates is inversely proportional to the plate separation.
  Thus a change in air pressure is detected by the variation in
  capacitance across the plates.
  <P>The sensor has the following measurement characteristics.

  <H4>(ii) The Temperature Sensor</H4>
  <P>Temperature is measured using the <A HREF="figures/figfour.html">&quot;Thermocap&quot;</A>
  temperature sensor. This device consists glass capsule, or radius
  1.5mm and length 2.5mm, shown schematically in <A HREF="figures/figfour.html">figure
  4</A>. The capsule contains a chip of ceramic dielectric, of
  dimensions 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.2mm, placed between two electrodes.
  <P>The capacitance across the electrodes is a function of temperature.
  Thus a change in air temperature is detected by the variation
  in capacitance across the electrodes.

  <H4>(iii) The Humidity Sensor</H4>
  <P>Humidity is measured using the &quot;Humicap&quot; humidity
  sensor. This device is a thin-film capacitor of dimensions 4
  x 4 x 0.2mm. A polymer dielectric of 1 micron thickness is placed
  between two electrodes.
  <P>The capacitance across the electrodes is a function of the
  amount of water absorbed by the polymer dielectric. Thus a change
  in the humidity of the atmosphere is detected by the variation
  in capacitance across the electrodes.
  <P>The sensor has the following measurement characteristics.

  <H3><A NAME="wind"></A>1.3 Windfinding Equipment</H3>
  <P>Wind speed and direction are not directly measured by the
  radiosonde. These parameters are calculated from the position
  of the sonde at successive time intervals. The UK upper air network
  currently use two such methods of windfinding. Each method requires
  additional equipment.
  <H4>(i) The LORAN-C Radio Navigation System</H4>
  <P>This system, in use at all but two UK stations, was originally
  established to aid navigation at sea. It uses a network of <B><EM>LO</EM></B>ng
  <B><EM>RA</EM></B>nge <B><EM>N</EM></B>avigation beacons, which
  transmit radio signals at known frequencies. In addition to the
  sensors of the RS80 already described, the RS80L radiosonde carries
  a <B>radio receiver</B> to detect the LORAN signals.
  <P>The receiver measures the difference in time taken for the
  signals from two beacons of known position to reach the sonde.
  Such points of equal time difference form the loci of a set of
  rectangular hyperbolae. Signals are received from three pairs
  of beacons. The difference in the time of signal reception from
  each pair identifies a hyperbola, as shown in <A HREF="figures/figfive.html">figure
  5</A>. The radiosonde is thus located at the intersection of
  these hyperbolae, a known distance from the fixed LORAN beacons.
  The wind speed and direction can then be calculated from the
  difference between successive positions of the sonde. These calculations
  are performed by the <A HREF="#ground">ground station equipment</A>.
  <P>The LORAN-C method calculates the position of the radisonde
  with an accuracy of approximately +/- 300m. Wind speeds are calculated
  with an accuracy of +/- 1 to 2ms<SUP>-1</SUP>.
   <H4>(ii) Tracking with Radar</H4>
  <P>The second method, in use at Larkhill and Aberporth, is to
  track the radiosonde with a windfinding radar. The RS80 must
  carry a <B>radar reflection shield</B>, as shown in <A HREF="figures/figone.html">figure
  1</A>, in order to reflect the beam emitted by the radar. The
  shield consists of three perpendicular intersecting planes made
  of metallised mesh.
  <P>The time for the beam to be returned to the radar provides
  the distance of the sonde from the radar. The radar also measures
  the sonde's angle of elevation and the bearing from true north.
  The sonde is thus located at a known distance, height and direction
  from the fixed radar. The wind speed and direction can then be
  calculated from the difference between successive positions of
  the sonde. These calculations are performed by the <A HREF="#ground">ground
  station equipment</A>.
  <P>The windfinding radar method enables wind speeds to be calculated
  with an accuracy of approximately +/- 1ms<SUP>-1</SUP> at a height
  of 7km. Height is accurate to within +/-40m.
  <H3><A NAME="ground"></A>1.4 Ground Station Equipment</H3>
  <P>The ground equipment of a radiosonde station varies with the
  type of sonde that is used but it must at least comprise a radio
  receiver and a means of interpreting the signals in terms of
  the meteorological quantities observed.<BR>
<BR>
  The Vaisala PC-Cora ground station is used by all of the UK upper
  air stations to recieve, record and process the measurements
  of pressure, temperature and humidity made by the radiosonde.
  It can be used to calculate wind speed and direction from either
  of the above windfinding methods.
  <H4>(i) Storing and processing the data</H4>
  <H4>(ii) Calculating dew-point temperature</H4>
  <H4>(iii) Calculating humidity mixing ratio</H4>
  <H4>(iv) Calculating height</H4>
  <H4>(v) Calculating wind speed and direction</H4>

<H2><A NAME="data"></A>2. The Data</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <H3><A NAME="measurements"></A>2.1 Measurements</H3>
  <P>The data consists of vertical profiles of temperature, dew-point
  temperature, wind speed and wind direction, from the surface to pressures
  of approximately 20mb. <BR>
<BR>
  
  <H3><A NAME="spatial"></A>2.2 Spatial Coverage</H3>
  <UL>
    <LI>Horizontal Coverage<BR>
    The BADC have data from stations <A HREF="/data/radiosglobe/world.html">worldwide</A>.
    Currently, the global radiosonde network includes about 900 upper-air
    stations, and about two-thirds make observations twice daily
    (at 0000 and 1200 UTC). The network is predominantly land-based
    and favours the Northern Hemisphere.
    <LI>Vertical Coverage<BR>
    A radiosonde is released from the surface and rises to between
    20 and 30km before the balloon bursts. The flight of the instrument
    varies according to the strength of the wind and thus may not
    ascend strictly vertically. Nevertheless, when analysing weather
    systems on the synoptic scale, the profiles can be assumed to
    be vertical without significant error.
  </UL>
  <H3><A NAME="temporal"></A>2.3 Temporal Coverage</H3>
  <P>Upper air data is reported up to four times per day at the
  synoptic hours of 00, 06, 12 and 18 GMT. The number of accents varies
  widely between countries and stations. 
  <P>Standard practice states that all measurements in the profile
  are attributed to the nominal hour of the ascent. This is the
  hour at which the sonde reaches 100mb. It takes approximately
  an hour for the balloon to rise to this level and thus the sondes
  are released one hour before the synoptic hours.
  <P>&nbsp;
  <H3><A NAME="resolution"></A>2.4 Resolution</H3>
  <P>The radiosonde takes measurements at intervals of approximately
  2 seconds. The high resolution data files contain all such data.
  The standard resolution data files contain measurements taken
  at particular levels of the atmosphere.
  <P>Upper air stations are required to submit standard resolution
    data to the Met Office. Measurements are reported at <B>standard</B>
    and <B>significant</B> pressure levels.
    <H5>(i) Standard Pressure Levels</H5>
    <P>The standard pressure levels are 1000, 925, 850, 700, 500,
    400, 300, 250, 200, 150, 100, 70, 50, 30, 20 and 10 mb.
    <H5>(ii) Significant Pressure Levels</H5>
    <P>These are levels added to give a clearer picture of the measured
    profile. For example at the top and bottom of an inversion, large
    changes in wind, temperature or humidity may well be missed by
    the standard levels. The surface and the highest level of the
    sounding are mandatory significant levels. Additional levels
    are also added to ensure that linear interpolation yields values
    of temperature which do not differ from the observed value by
    1 degree C below 300 hPa and 2 degrees C after that.</BLOCKQUOTE>
