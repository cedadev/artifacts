<H2><A NAME="exec"></A>1. FIRETRACC Executive Summary</H2>
<EM>(Excerpted from the FIRETRACC Final Report to the European Commission, June 2000)</em>
<P>
The FIRETRACC project aims are to determine the history of numerous trace gases of both man-made
 (pollution) and natural origin over the 20th century in the global atmosphere. This has been
 achieved by pumping ‘old’ air out of deep unconsolidated snow (known as ‘firn’) that accumulates
 to depths of around 50 to 100 m on the polar ice caps of both hemispheres. The resulting firn
 air samples from the Arctic and Antarctic were returned to Europe, where they were examined
 with a battery of highly sensitive state-of-the-art gas analysers in a number of research
 laboratories. The measured concentrations were then processed using computer-based models
 of both the physical migration of gases through firn, and of their chemical behaviour and
 transport in the global atmosphere. In this way we have been able to both reconstruct the
 past history of these gases since the first half of the 20th century, and also to assess
 the implications of these changes for past atmospheric composition and chemistry.

<P>
The project has been highly successful with all three planned polar firn drilling and firn
 air extraction expeditions successfully completed. This is recognised in glaciological
 circles as a considerable accomplishment in itself. The firn air samples have been
 analysed for well over eighty separate trace gases, and thirteen different isotopic
 measurements of CO2, CH4, CO and permanent gases (O2, N2, Ar, Kr). These are by far the
 most comprehensive measurements of past atmospheric composition made to date.

<P>
For the majority of gases measured, the time frame of the firn air samples encompasses most
 of their history of human production and emission during the period of intense 20th century
 industrialisation. The records show a variety of growth rates of different trace gases. Some
 clearly peaked at dates ranging from the early 1970’s to the 1990’s and have since declined.
 Some have reached almost level concentrations, whilst others have continued to rise throughout.
 We are now able to much better define the relative contribution of natural sources, where they
 exist, for the gases measured, and thus assess the impact of human activity of the chemical
 composition of the atmosphere. Comparisons of trends between the two hemispheres are
 particularly informative, since differential behaviour points to changes in global
 atmospheric chemical processes.

<p>
A major outcome of the project has been the observation that, despite the very large changes
 in pollution levels clearly observed in firn air, notably in the Northern Hemisphere,
 there is no evidence for substantial changes in global levels of the hydroxyl radical
 (OH). OH is the primary oxidising agent by which the atmosphere rids itself of many
 ozone-depleting and global-warming gases. This cleansing action - the ‘oxidising capacity’ 
– of the atmosphere therefore appears to be relatively robust against wholesale changes in
 global pollution load.

<p>
We have also measured all of the key gases involved in chemical destruction of
 stratospheric ozone. We have, therefore, an almost complete record of changes in the
 composition of the stratosphere, that can be used to help us understand both past
 and potential future sensitivity of stratospheric ozone to changing pollution emissions.

<p>
By studying the past response of the atmosphere to changes in pollution levels we
 shall be better able to predict the effect of future changes in pollution loading,
 either negative or positive, on the radiative balance and chemical reactivity of the
 Earth’s atmosphere. Furthermore, the findings of this work on air-snow transfer, 
and the improvements in diffusion and thermo-diffusion modelling, together provide
 a fundamental advance in the knowledge base needed to interpret ice core records
 spanning longer time periods, such as climatic cycles.

<p>
The data from FIRETRACC is to be permanently archived by an independent database
 provider (the British Atmospheric Data Centre). Starting 31 July 2001 this data
 will become accessible to the public via an intuitive web-based interface
 (http://www.badc.rl.ac.uk/data/firetracc). The web pages will also
 contain information on the programme. Not only will the data be available,
 but so too will the improved firn diffusion model developed during the
 course of FIRETRACC. This will be a valuable asset to other researchers
 with an interest in firn air, as well as to others from wider fields studying
 the diffusion of gases through porous media (e.g. oil and gas exploration,
 groundwater resources and pollution, etc.).

<p>
The project has been highly pro-active in disseminating it’s findings. 
A number of <a href="references.html">publications</a> have been written in top ranking
 journals such as Science, the Journal of Geophysical Research,
 and Geophysical Research Letters. There have also been numerous presentations of
 FIRETRACC findings at prestigious international symposia. These include meetings
 of the European Geophysical Society, the American Geophysical Union, the International
 Global Atmospheric Chemistry Project, the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics,
 the International Association of Meteorology and Atmospheric Sciences, and the Commission
 on Atmospheric Chemistry and Global Pollution. We also convened a Special Session on
 <a href="http://134.76.234.216/ScientificProgramme/oa41..oral.htm">"Atmospheric composition
and chemistry of the 20th century from firn records"</a> at
 the European Geophysical Society's XXV General Assembly and Millennium Conference
 in Nice, 25 - 29 April 2000.

<H2><A NAME="firn"></A>2. How to capture firn air</H2>
<P>Extraction of firn-air from boreholes drilled into the ice
sheet has a ten-year long history, with early work in using this
techniques carried out by French and Swiss (J. Schwander, <I>et
al.</I>, J. Geophys. Res., 98, 2831-2838, 1993). However, in recent
years the technique has become more widely used with the development
of modern instruments for measuring extremely low levels of trace
gases, and the isotopic composition of major atmospheric gases.
Generally though, the technique for the extraction of the firn-air
remains similar to that used by the early pioneers in this field:
a borehole is drilled into the ice sheet to the desired depth,
then an bladder is lowered to the bottom of the borehole and inflated
to block the passage of air from above. Air is then extracted
by pumps at the surface from the small space beneath the bladder
and compressed into flasks for later analysis. The main advantage
of this technique for sampling air is the very high volumes that
can be extracted since the air pocket beneath the bladder is constantly
replenished by leakage from the surrounding firn. In contrast,
air trapped in bubbles in the ice is usually only available in
small volumes. 

<P>The firn-air pumping system consists of 5 items: an inflatable
bladder, with aluminium end-caps; tubing to carry the firn-air
from depth to the surface; a diaphragm pump for managing the air-pressure
in the bladder; a metal-bellow pump for filling the low-pressure
flasks; a piston pump for filling high-pressure flasks. The inflatable
bladder assembly&nbsp;(Figure 1) consists of a 5m length of 140mm
diameter rubber tube, mounted onto two end caps. At all sites,
the lower end cap incorporated a baffle system (the &quot;Bender-baffle&quot;
&#150; initially suggested by Dr. Mike Bender of Princeton University)
to eliminate the possibility of blocking the sample tubes by pressing
the into the firn at the bottom of the hole, and to provide two
compartments from which the air is pumped &#150; the detail is
shown in Figure 2. Of the two gas samples tubes, one projected
into the upper compartment of the baffle, while the second projected
into the lower compartment. When extracting the low volume samples,
the upper compartment was pumped to the surface and on to waste
at high flow rate, while the lower compartment was pumped at a
lower flow rate and compressed into the sample flasks. This reduced
contamination of the sample from any slight leakage past the lower
end cap. 

<P>At each site, a LI-CORR CO<SUB>2</SUB> analyser was available
to monitor CO<SUB>2</SUB> levels in real time. During firn pumping
this level would slowly fall from the modern ambient level (present
from the air forced down the borehole by the piston effect) to
achieve a constant value that represented the value in the air
flowing into the bottom of the borehole from the surrounding firn.
Once the constant level was achieved, and we were confident that
the correct firn-air was being drawn from the hole, the sample
flasks could be filled.

<P>Samples have been collected in both hemispheres. This is important
to obtain a global picture of the changing composition of the
atmosphere. By comparing hemispheres we can deduce a lot about
the sources of the gases we measure, whether they are natural
or human-made, how quickly the gases are broken down by natural
processes in the atmosphere, and whether human-influences have
upset these natural cleansing processes.

<H2><A NAME="science"></A>4. Scientific Description of the project</H2>
<P>Firn air (air trapped in deep polar snow) has been collected
and analysed to determine a record of trace gases in the Northern
and Southern hemispheres from the early-mid 20<SUP>th</SUP> century
to the present day. An improved firn air pumping system was developed
allowing both low and high pressure samples to be collected cleanly
and quickly. Samples were collected by drilling to successive
depths, and at each depth letting down an inflatable seal and
pumping inlet. <I>In situ</I> monitoring of CO<SUB>2</SUB> allowed
field verification that only &#145;old&#146; air was being collected
during pumping operations. Attention was given to the sample containers
used to ensure sample stability during transport and storage.
Pumping of large volumes of air allowed samples to be circulated
between laboratories for repeated analysis of different suites
of trace gases at ultra-trace levels, and even full isotopic composition
of trace gases such as CO and CH<SUB>4</SUB>. 

<P>Samples were analysed with a range of instruments, mostly based
on gas chromatography and/or mass spectrometry. The key measurements
included CO and CH<SUB>4</SUB> and their isotopic composition,
hydrocarbons, alkyl nitrates, reactive halocarbons and COS. Trends
of the more stable trace gases were also determined (e.g. CO<SUB>2</SUB>,
CH<SUB>4</SUB>, N<SUB>2</SUB>O, CFCs, SF<SUB>6</SUB>, perfluorocarbons,
etc.). 

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1"><IMG SRC="figures/scifigure.gif" BORDER="1" WIDTH="500" HEIGHT="240"
ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></FONT></B> 

<P>A firn diffusion model, operating in both direct and inverse
modes, was developed and validated using multiple trace gas measurements.
Measurements of isotopes and concentration ratios of permanent
gases enabled gravitational and thermal effects to be properly
modelled and accounted for. Firn diffusion modelling was combined
with 2-D atmospheric chemical models to determine the trends of
the trace gases of interest.
