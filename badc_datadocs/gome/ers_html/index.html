<h2>Abstract</h2>
<dl>
<dd>
Measurements by ESA's Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME) contain
information about the vertical profile of ozone in addition
to its total column. Height-resolved ozone distributions spanning the
troposphere and stratosphere between 50N and 80S have been
retrieved from two orbits of data crossing the east
Pacific and north America on 11th January 1996.
The height vs latitude cross-section over the
E.Pacific is in broad agreement with the troposphere / lower stratosphere
distribution calculated for January by a
zonally-averaged (2-D) chemical-transport model. A large enhancement to
tropospheric ozone is detected by GOME over southern California, which we
assume to be due to local photochemical production.
Support for the major features seen in the two GOME cross-sections is provided
by intercomparison of retrieved profiles with 19 co-located ozonesondes.
The standard deviation in fractional difference
is <10% in the stratosphere and <30% in the troposphere, and the bias
is <5% above 6km and -25% below 6km (possibly due to cloud
contamination).

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME) was launched on ESA's ERS-2
satellite in April 1995. GOME is a downward-viewing spectrometer which measures
backscattered solar radiation in the wavelength range 237-790nm at moderate
spectral resolution (0.2-0.4nm). Measurements of backscattered UV radiation
made by the series of TOMS and SBUV instruments have provided ozone column and
profile data for nearly two decades. Since GOME measures the UV spectrum
contiguously and with higher resolution, it should, in principle, yield
height-resolved ozone data of higher quality, as well as total column
measurements of additional constituents such as NO2 and BrO.
Instruments of a similar class to GOME are planned for launch on ESA's
ENVISAT in 1999 and the METOP series commencing in 2002. The performance of
GOME therefore has implications for monitoring the global ozone distribution
from space well beyond the ERS-2 mission.</p>
<p>

A zonal-mean cross-section of stratospheric ozone retrieved from GOME Band 1A
measurements on 11th January 1996 has previously been compared to those derived
from SSBUV and MLS measurements and found to agree generally to within 10%
<a href="#MUNRO">[Munro]</a>. Good agreement has also been demonstrated previously
in comparisons between individual Band 2B retrievals for cloud-free scenes and
co-located, mid-latitude ozonesonde profiles <a href="#MUNRO">[Munro]</a>. In this
paper, preliminary Band 2B
retrievals are presented for a more comprehensive range of observing conditions
and cloud contamination, as sampled in two complete orbits on 11th January 1996.</p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>

<p>Retrieval of ozone profiles from backscattered UV spectra is an
under-constrained problem. However, by combining
measurement information with that from an <em>a priori</em> profile,
the Optimal Estimation (OE) <a href="#RODGERS">[Rodgers]</a>
retrieval method
allows a sufficient constraint to be applied, while retaining flexibility
in profile representation.
<em>a priori</em> ozone
profiles and uncertainties used by the OE retrieval scheme were selected for
the most appropriate latitude
and month from a zonal-mean climatology derived from SAGE II.</p>
<p>

This study used as its primary input GOME Level-1 Products. These contain
measured, backscattered spectra which
have been calibrated radiometrically and in wavelength. They also contain
measurements of direct-sun spectra acquired in-flight via a
diffuser. The measured quantity used by the retrieval
scheme was in fact the ratio of backscattered (radiance) to direct-sun
(irradiance) spectra, referred to here as <em>reflectance</em>.</p>
<p>

To synthesise reflectance spectra, the GOMETRAN radiative transfer model
<a href="#ROZANOV">[Rozanov]</a> was
interfaced to the retrieval
scheme. This model has a wavelength
resolution appropriate to GOME and incorporates gaseous absorption, surface
reflection and scattering by air molecules, aerosol and cloud. Multiple
scattering is accounted for by the method of finite differences. In this
study, a fixed, single profile was adopted for aerosol scattering
and cloud has been neglected.</p>
<p>

The GOME wavelength range is divided into a number of Bands, of which only Bands
1A and 2B, covering the ranges
237-307nm and 312-405nm, respectively, were
used in this study. Measurement integration times are 12s for Band 1A and 0.375s
for Band 2B, hence the scene viewed by the latter is only a small fraction of
that viewed by the former. For the swath-width used on the day in question,
integration was over a scene of dimensions
~960km (across-track) by ~80-120km (along-track) for Band 1A and 80km
(across-track) by 40km (along-track) for Band 2B. Furthermore, the properties of
O3 absorption differ substantially between the two Bands. In Band 1A, O3
opacity is large and decreases monotonically with increasing wavelength from
the peak of the Hartley band at 254nm; in Band 2B, it is relatively small and
has a complicated, temperature-dependent wavelength variation in the Huggins
bands below 340nm. Because of these important differences in viewing geometry
and O3 absorption properties, a two-step approach was adopted for
Bands 1A and 2B.</p>

<h2>Band 1A Retrievals</h2>

<p>In the first step, every fourth Band 1A pixel in two adjacent orbits crossing
the E.Pacific and N.America on 11th January 1996 was processed. The 
<em>a priori</em>
information on ozone (including its covariance) was taken from the SAGE II
climatology for January (figure 1). In the troposphere,
where SAGE II provides no information,
volume mixing ratios corresponding to an approximately constant tropospheric
concentration of 1e12 molecules/cm3, with 100% error were used.
Before generating reflectance spectra, a
wavelength-dependent correction factor was applied to the direct-sun spectrum
in accordance with the SOLSTICE/GOME irradiance
comparison <a href="#PEETERS">[Peeters]</a> (see <a href="#NOTE_1">note 1</a>).</p>

<p align="center"><img src="apo3_conc.gif" alt="Figure 1."><br>
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p align="center"><em>
Figure 1. The <em> a priori</em> ozone distribution for January
(1e12 molecules/cm3).
    </em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Retrieval levels were specified at 0, 6 and 12km and then at 4km intervals
up to 80km. Wavelengths <260nm
were omitted
along with those most seriously affected by NO gamma band emission and
Fraunhofer absorption. In addition to the O3 profile, it was necessary to
retrieve in parallel: an effective surface reflectance;
a scaling-factor and wavelength shift for the Ring cross-section;
a wavelength shift with respect to the
reference O3 absorption cross-section spectrum and a wavelength-independent
dark-current signal offset. Viewing geometry was taken from
the Level-1 Product and the most appropriate temperature profile for each
ground-pixel was extracted from the UK Met. Office analysis for the day.
To represent the scan-angle dependence of the instrument's polarisation
response adequately, it was necessary to calculate spectra for at least three
angles, interpolate and integrate with respect to angle.</p>
<p>

In the second step, the two centre (ie nadir) Band 2B pixels corresponding to
each Band 1A pixel were processed , using the
retrieved ozone profile and
covariance matrix from Band 1A as <em>a priori</em> information 
(see <a href="#NOTE_2">note 2</a>).
As a pre-cursor to this, the effective surface reflectance in each Band 2B
pixel was retrieved near 340nm, where atmospheric absorption by
ozone and other gases is relatively small.
A sub-set of wavelengths in the range 323.0-334.5nm was used for O3
retrievals from Band 2B. In
order to maximize sensitivity to the spectral signature of temperature
dependent O3 absorption in the Huggins bands (from which
height-resolved information is gained) and to minimize
sensitivity to scattering and reflecting media, ln(reflectance)
was used as the
measured quantity and a 2nd order polynomial subtracted from measured and
calculated spectra before fitting.</p>
<p>

Unwanted spectral structure is present in the measured reflectance
spectrum due to
NO2 absorption, the Ring effect, wavelength shifts between measurements of
backscattered and direct-sun spectra and wavelength offsets with respect to
the reference O3 absorption cross-section spectrum. To reduce RMS residuals
between measured and calculated reflectance
spectra to the level needed (<0.2%) to
extract O3 information of good quality from the troposphere, it was
necessary to
account for NO2 using a single, fixed profile and to retrieve the other
quantities jointly
with O3.</p>
<p>

The same two-step methodology was applied to process GOME data for comparison
with the nineteen ozonesondes.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>In figure 2, a height vs latitude cross-section is
presented of the ratio of
uncertainties in retrieved and <em>a priori</em> ozone profiles for the E.Pacific
orbit. The fractional decrease indicates where and by how much
GOME measurements have contributed new information. The largest decrease
is around tropopause level (approx.16km at the equator)
, and the decrease is significant right down
to ground level, demonstrating that GOME measurements
contain information on the distribution of tropospheric as well as
stratospheric ozone (see <a href="#NOTE_3">note 3</a>).</p>

The height vs latitude cross-section of retrieved ozone concentration
for the E.Pacific orbit is presented in figure 4(a) and the orbital
variation in column ozone obtained by integrating the retrieved profile (up to
40km) is
compared to the operationally-derived GOME total column (Level-2 Product) in
figure 4(b). Along-track
variations in the integrated column are seen to closely
follow those in the
Level-2 Product and the integrated
column is typically 4% lower than the Level-2 Product.</p>
<p>

The 340nm reflectance retrieved by the RAL scheme is plotted in figure
4(c) together with the cloud-fraction derived in DLR operational
processing. The scaling factor for the Ring cross-section
retrieved for Band 2B by the RAL scheme is plotted in figure 4(d).
Variations in retrieved 340nm reflectance are seen to be highly correlated with
the operationally-derived cloud-fraction 
(see <a href="#NOTE_4">note 4</a>) and anti-correlated with those in the
Ring scaling factor (see <a href="#NOTE_5">note 5</a>).
The pixels most seriously contaminated by cloud (eg. those near 35N,
22N, 18S, 27S and 44S) are associated
with anomalously low ozone columns and retrieved
tropospheric concentrations, as might be anticipated.</p>

    </em></p>
</blockquote>

The general morphology of the retrieved ozone height-latitude cross-section in
figure 4(a) agrees broadly with that calculated by a
zonally-averaged (2-D)
chemical-transport model <a href="#HOUGH">[Hough]</a> (figure 3).
There is a minimum in tropospheric ozone centred near 20S at ground
level which moves equatorwards with increasing height to approx.10km.
At middle and high southern latitudes, tropospheric concentrations increase
with height and with latitude.
The concentration of ozone in the lower troposphere tends to be larger in the
northern hemisphere than at equivalent southern latitudes.</p>
<p>

Comparison of the height-latitude cross-section retrieved for the E.Pacific
orbit (figure 4(a)) with that retrieved over N.America
(figure 4(e)) indicates broad
agreement in the troposphere, except in the latitude range
30N-40N where ozone concentrations are clearly
enhanced over southern California (approx. 1.5e12 cm-3 cf
approx. 0.7e12 cm-3 at
equivalent latitudes over the E.Pacific). We assume this enhancement to be due
to local photochemical production of ozone. Cloud contamination in the pixels
immediately north of 40N limits the horizontal extent of
the enhanced region detected by GOME.</p>
<p>

A second feature of interest in the N.American orbit is the local maximum in
ozone at approx.15S which occurs in the stratosphere and propagates
down to the tropopause (approx.15km) and below. The coherence of this feature
and the absence of serious cloud-contamination suggests it to be a low-latitude
intrusion of stratospheric air into the troposphere.</p>
<p>

GOME retrievals have been compared to nineteen co-located ozonesonde profiles,
acquired
over Europe (including northern Scandinavia) between July 1995 and April 1996.
The means and standard deviations of fractional differences in
integrated sub-columns between retrieval levels are shown
in figure 5 for: (i) <em>A priori</em> profiles (SAGE II
January climatology); (ii) Band 1A retrieved profiles and (iii) Band 2B
retrieved profiles.  The Band 1A retrieved profiles have substantially smaller
standard deviations and biasses than the <em>a priori</em> profiles
(see <a href="#NOTE_6">note 6</a>).
For Band 2B retrieved profiles, standard deviations are <10% in 4km
layers between 16 and 32km, approx.20% between 12 and 16km, approx.30%
between 6 and 12km and approx.20% between 0 and 6km. Below 16km, these
values are significantly lower than for Band 1A, indicating the benefit of Band
2B for retrievals in the troposphere and lower stratosphere.
The Band 2B bias (<5%) in layers above 6km is
also smaller than that for Band 1A. The bias of -25% in
the 0-6km layer is probably due in part to cloud
contamination in some scenes.
(No attempt was made to select cloud-free Band 2B scenes for this
intercomparison with
ozonesondes.) Although limited in scope, this intercomparison does suggest that
the combination of Band 1A and 2B measurements provides GOME with the
capability to retrieve height-resolved ozone information of good
quality in the troposphere as well as the stratosphere.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>The ``two-step'' scheme developed previously to retrieve ozone profiles
spanning the troposphere and stratosphere from GOME Band 1A and 2B measurements
has been applied to two orbits of data acquired on 11th January 1996.
The general morphology of
the retrieved ozone height-latitude cross-section in the troposphere for the
E.Pacific orbit is in broad agreement with that calculated for the same time
of year by a zonally-averaged (2-D) chemical-transport model. A large
enhancement to tropospheric ozone over southern California is clearly evident
in the retrieved cross-section for the consecutive orbit. Support for the major
features seen in the two cross-sections comes from an intercomparison
of GOME-retrieved profiles with nineteen co-located
ozonesondes, from which the standard deviation in fractional difference
was found to be <10% in the stratosphere and less than or equal to 30% in the troposphere,
and the bias was found to be
<5% above 6km and -25% below 6km (possibly due to cloud
contamination).</p>
<p>

From results presented in this paper, it can be concluded: (i) that the global
distribution of ozone in the troposphere as well as the stratosphere
could be retrieved from GOME measurements through large-scale processing of
data and (ii) that the accuracy of retrieved global fields would benefit from
high quality cloud information, such as that available from ATSR-2,
flying alongside GOME on ERS-2.</p>


<h2>Notes</h2>

<p><a name="NOTE_1">1.</a> Post-launch degradation was assumed
to have occurred in the calibration unit and therefore to have only
affected direct-sun spectra. This correction improves
(by approx.10%) the
agreement between GOME and other satellite sensors in the upper
stratosphere, but has little impact on results presented
here.</p>

<p><a name="NOTE_2">2.</a> Prior 
to its use in generating the reflectance spectrum, the Band 2B direct-sun
spectrum was
used to improve absolute wavelength calibration and knowledge of the
spectrometer slit-width. This was achieved by fitting segments of the
measured spectrum in a piece-wise fashion to calculations which used a
0.01nm resolution solar reference <a href="#CHANCE">[Chance]</a>.</p>

<p><a name="NOTE_3">3.</a> The fractional reduction 
is smaller in the stratosphere because of the
higher quality of <em>a priori</em> information available from the SAGE II
climatology; uncertainty is typically 12% at the height of the peak ozone number 
density (approx.25km at the equator).</p>

<p><a name="NOTE_4">4.</a> Absolute values of
operationally-derived cloud-fraction can be up to a factor two too
high (K.Chance, pri.comm.).</p>

<p><a name="NOTE_5">5.</a> The Ring
scaling factor is proportional to the number of N2 and O2
molecules in the optical path, which is suppressed when clouds are present,
particularly at high altitude.</p>

<p><a name="NOTE_6">6.</a> Except that the standard 
deviation for the 0-6km sub-column is
smaller for the single, fixed <em>a priori</em> profile than for the Band 1A
retrieved profiles.}.</p>
