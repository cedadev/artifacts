<P>TOMS was one of eight instruments designed to provide continuous,
long-term monitoring of atmospheric, oceanic and surface parameters
on a global basis throughout most of the 1980s. The Nimbus-7 TOMS
instrument operated from 1st November 1978 to 5th May 1993.</P>

<P>The Nimbus-7 TOMS instrument measures backscattered ultraviolet
radiance from Earth at wavelength bands centred at 312.5, 317.5,
331.3, 339.9, 360.0 and 380.0 nanometres. The first four wavelengths
are sensitive to ozone; the two longer wavelengths are used for
estimating the scene reflectivity necessary for deriving ozone
amounts. The instrument is a single stage fixed-grating Ebert-Fastie
monochromater with a rotating chopper wheel to resolve the incoming
light into these 6 wavelength bands with a one nanometer bandpass.</P>

<P>Total column ozone is inferred from the differential absorption
of scattered sunlight in the ultraviolet using the ratio of two
wavelengths, 312nm and 331nm for instance, where one wavelength
is strongly absorbed by ozone while the other is weakly absorbed.
TOMS scans in the cross-track direction in 3 degree steps from
51 degrees on one side of nadir to 51 degrees on the other, for
a total of 35 samples. The instantaneous field-of-view (IFOV)
of 3 degrees x 3 degrees results in a footprint varying from a
50 km x 50 km square at nadir to a 130 km by 300 km diamond at
the scan extremes. The total swath width is 3000 km, implying
that consecutive orbits overlap to create a contiguous mapping
of ozone data. Approximately 200,000 measurements are made on
a daily basis during the sunlit portions of the orbits.</P>

<P>Nimbus-7 is in a south-north sun synchronous polar orbit such
that it is always close to a local noon/midnight beneath the satellite.
Thus, ozone over the entire world is measured every 24 hours.</P>

<H4>1.1.2 Meteor-3 TOMS</H4>

<P><EM>Sources: Goddard Space Flight Center online documentation
and WWW pages.</EM></P>

<P>Meteor-3 was launched on August 15, 1991 from Plesetsk, Russia,
and failed on 27th December 1994. The orbit drifts with respect
to the sun angle with a period of 212 days. Complete global measurements
are made except when the orbit is near the day-night terminator.
Under these conditions, the TOMS instrument may not be able to
view one of the hemispheres for a period of up to 3 weeks. This
differs from the Nimbus-7/TOMS ozone data obtained in a near-noon
sun synchronous orbit.</P>

<P>Because of the precessing nature of the Meteor-3 orbit (precession
period = 212 days), the equator crossing time goes from noon (overhead
sun, solar zenith angle = 0 deg) to the terminator (solar zenith
angle = 90 deg). The best data quality is when the equator crossing
time of the ascending node of the orbit is between 10am and 2pm
or between 10pm and 2am (which indicates that the equator crossing
time of the descending node of the orbit is between 10am and 2pm).
Good data quality is obtained over a wider range of equator crossing
times.</P>

<P>Ozone is calculated from the measured radiances by first forming
the ratio with measured irradiances (solar view) in each wavelength
channel. These ratios, known as directional albedos, are further
combined into ratios of directional albedos from 2 wavelength
channels.</P>

<P><EM>Sources: Goddard Space Flight Center WWW pages.</EM></P>

<P>Earth-Probe TOMS was launched on 2nd July 1996. The satellite
is being flown in a 500km polar orbit, rather than the 950 km
orbit that was originally planned. While ADEOS TOMS gives full
daily global coverage, Earth-Probe will be unable to do so for
ozone measurements within 60 degrees of the equator. However it
will give full coverage at the poles. In addition, the lower orbit
will give increased resolution and increase the probability of
making measurements over cloudless scenes, due to the smaller
&quot;footprint&quot;. The lower orbit will also improve the ability
of the TOMS instrument to make measurements of UV-absorbing aerosols
in the troposphere, a capability that was recently developed using
earlier TOMS data. The increased probability of making measurements
over cloud-free areas will enhance the capability of converting
the TOMS aerosol measurements into geophysical quantities such
as optical depth. The increased resolution available with the
lower orbit may even result in the ability of the TOMS instrument
to detect urban-scale aerosols such as pollution. The wavelengths
used by Earth-Probe TOMS are:</P>

<P>The ADEOS TOMS instrument was launched on 17th Aug 1996 from
Tanegashima Space Center in Japan. ADEOS is the Advanced Earth
Observing Satellite, developed by NASDA (the National Space Development
Agency of Japan). The instrument is designed to operate for 3
years. The satellite is flying in a 800km orbit, giving full daily
global coverage, and uses the following wavebands: 308.6, 312.5,
317.5, 332.2, 331.2, 360.0 nm. <HR ALIGN=LEFT><A NAME="Processing"></A>Go

<H3>1.2 Data Processing</H3>

<P><EM>Source: &quot;Nimbus-7 TOMS Data Products Users Guide&quot;
(NASA reference publication 1384)</EM></P>

<P>The retrieval of total ozone is based on a table look-up and
interpolation process. A table is constructed that gives backscattered
radiance as a function of total ozone, optical slant path length,
surface pressure, surface reflectivity and latitude. Given the
computed radiances for the latitude, surface pressure, reflectivity
and slant path for a particular radiance measurement, the total
ozone value for the scan can be derived by interpolation in the
table.</P>

<P>The two shortest TOMS wavelengths are strongly absorbed by
ozone and only very weakly absorbed by other atmospheric components.
At wavelengths above 310 nm, the backscattered radiance is primarily
solar radiation reflected from the Earth's surface and the troposphere.
Since 90% of the ozone is in the stratosphere, the backscattered
radiance at 310nm and higher is only weakly dependent on the vertical
distribution of ozone.</P>

<P>Derivation of ozone values from backscattered radiance requires
an understanding of reflections from the Earth's surface and scattering
from clouds and other aerosols. The scattered or reflected light
depends upon both the incident angle of the sunlight and the satellite
viewing angle. In practice, the cloud and aerosol contributions
can be treated as if the effective lower boundary of the atmosphere
is located at an average pressure in the troposphere (the &quot;scene
pressure&quot;), with an effective reflectivity (the &quot;scene
reflectivity&quot;) that accounts for scattering from clouds,
tropospheric aerosols and the Earth's surface. Values for these
quantities are derived for every instantaneous field-of-view (IFOV)
of the instrument, although this is not possible where stratospheric
aerosols are present (e.g. from volcanic eruptions).</P>

<P>The backscattered radiance is dependent on atmospheric and
surface components, where only the surface component depends on
the scene reflectivity. The scene reflectivity can be calculated
from the longest two TOMS wavelengths, which are not sensitive
to ozone. The measured backscattered radiances are corrected for
wavelength drift and changes in instrument optics and sensitivity,
and used in the formulation of &quot;N-values&quot;, which depend
on the ratio of backscattered intensity to the incident intensity
at the level of the instrument. A set of tables is created to
relate total ozone to this ratio, taking into account climatological
ozone profiles, pressure of the reflecting surface (2 values are
used, 1000 and 400mb), solar zenith angle and satellite zenith
angle at the IFOV.</P>

<P>In calculating total ozone, radiance ratios called Pair values
are computed. These are ratios of the backscattered to incident
radiation ratio at two wavelengths, where the longer wavelength
is insensitive to ozone while the shorter is sensitive. The values
are separated by 20nm or less in order to keep the scattering
effects approximately the same and ensure that their relative
attenuation is sensitive mostly to ozone absorption. The choice
of pair depends on the conditions: high or low sun angle, ozone
values etc.</P>

<P>For each of the three Pair values, four total ozone estimates
are made by table interpolation. The four values correspond to
the two pressure values, 1000 and 400 mb, and two standard latitudes
situated on either side of the measured latitude. Linear interpolation
in pressure and then in latitude yields the Pair ozone value at
the scene pressure and measured latitude.</P>

<P>A &quot;best&quot; value comes from a weighted average of the
total ozone from the A, B and C Pairs, taking into account sensitivity
of each pair to ozone profile shape, solar zenith angle and changes
in total ozone. The daily gridded product is then calculated by
averaging the data over 1 degree (latitude) by 1.25 degree (longitude)
cells, after rejecting values with stratospheric aerosol contamination,
inconsistent pair ozone or anomalous ozone or reflectivity values.</P>

<P>The first TOMS data released by NASA was processed using version
4 of the software; versions 1 to 3 were for development only.
In 1985, Version 5 introduced newly approved ozone absorption
coefficients (Bass and Paur). Version 6 introduced a stabilised
long-term calibration to compensate for the observed drift in
derived total ozone values resulting from an error in the correction
for the diffuser plate degradation. The most recent processing
version, Version 7, uses a revised instrument calibration based
on analysis of the entire 14.5 year data record, as well as an
improved algorithm. Improvements include:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>corrected 0.2 nm wavelength calibration error; this error
  caused a 3% absolute offset relative to Dobson
  <LI>use of wavelength &quot;triplets&quot; that correct for errors
  linear in wavelength
  <LI>improved ISCCP cloud height climatology, higher resolution
  terrain height maps
  <LI>use of improved profile shape selection to improve total
  ozone at very large solar zenith angles
  <LI>use of a more accurate model for partially-clouded scenes
  <LI>improved radiative transfer calculations for table generation
</UL>

<H2>2. TOMS data</H2>

<H3><A NAME="Ozone"></A>2.1 'Column' or 'total' ozone measurements
and units</H3>

<P>TOMS measures `column' ozone (sometimes referred to as `total'
ozone), ie the total amount of ozone in a column of unit area
above the Earth's surface. The data is stored as gridded averages.</P>

<P>Column ozone is usually expressed in terms of the equivalent
thickness of the ozone layer at standard temperature and pressure
(0 degrees C, 1013.25 mb). If an entire column of ozone (i.e.
the mass per unit area in a column of air extending from the surface
to the top of the atmosphere) is brought to standard temperature
and pressure, the thickness of the column would be, on average,
about 3 millimetres.</P>

<P>The units of the TOMS column ozone measurements are Dobson
Units (DU), where 1 DU = 10 E-5 metres, also expressed as a milli-atmosphere-centimetre
of ozone. Hence, a typical value of column ozone is of the order
of 300 DU.</P>

<H3><A NAME="Spatial"></A>2.2 Spatial coverage and resolution</H3>

<P>TOMS measurements cover the whole globe from -90 to 90 degrees
latitude, -180 to 180 degrees longitude. However, an individual
day's coverage can never be truly global since the instrument
relies on backscattered UV and there are always some areas of
the Earth in shade.</P>

<P>The data is gridded such that the cell area over which each
measurement is made is roughly constant. The Earth is divided
into 1 degree latitude zones, each of which is subdivided into
a number of longitude cells. The number of cells is allowed to
vary with latitude, from 288 at the equator to 72 at the poles,
as shown in the table below. Because the constant separation in
degrees between orbits corresponds to a smaller distance in kilometres
closer to the poles, a particular cell may be viewed from several
adjacent orbits in the higher latitudes (at approx. 100 minutes
time interval).</P>

<P>In the ASCII data files, higher latitude measurements are repeated
such that there is a constant 288 measurements per latitude zone.</P>

Prior to this date, TOMS followed a regular on/off schedule for

<H2>3. Data quality overview</H2>

<P><EM>Source: &quot;Nimbus-7 TOMS Data Products User's Guide&quot;,
McPeters et al, NASA Reference Publication 1384. See also &quot;Meteor-3
Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) Data Products User's Guide&quot;,
NASA reference publication 1393</EM></P>

<P>TOMS data is subject to uncertainties from several sources,
a few of which are outlined here. For a full discussion of these
uncertainties you should refer to the source document.</P>

<H3><A NAME="Albedo"></A>3.1 Accuracy and precision of the TOMS
albedo</H3>

<P>Uncertainty in the albedo used in total ozone retrieval depends
on three factors:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>the laboratory calibration, where an error could lead to
  a bias in the retrieved ozone values
  <LI>changes with time of the instrument sensitivity, which could
  lead to a drift with time of the retrieved ozone values
  <LI>precision of the derived ozone values, which depends on instrument
  noise and atmospheric variability within the field of view.
</UL>

<P>The laboratory calibration depends on the accuracy of the standard
calibration lamp and the accuracy with which the reflecting properties
of the instrument diffuser plate are known. This is known to be
better than +/-3%. The accuracy of the long-term calibration depends
on the accuracy with which changes with time of the diffuser plate
optical properties can be modelled. Studies by Herman et al (1991)
estimate that this accuracy produces a 1.3% uncertainty in long-term
ozone trends over the first 10 years of data. The study by Gleason
et al (1993) indicates that this accuracy was maintained through
the first 14 yeas of data. The precision of the TOMS albedo measurement
is better than 0.8% at all wavelengths.</P>

<P>Uncertainties in the instrument wavelength can also lead to
uncertainties in the retrieved ozone, since radiance is measured
at a &quot;known&quot; wavelength. If the measurement wavelengths
are not those specified, the backscattered radiation will not
match the algorithm, leading to an error in the ozone value. It
is estimated that the initial Nimbus-7 TOMS wavelength calibration
was known to +/-0.5nm accuracy and that the calibration drifted
by less than 0.005nm over the life of the instrument.</P>

<H3><A NAME="Errors"></A>3.2 Random, time-invariant and time-dependent
errors</H3>

<P>TOMS ozone retrievals are subject to random, time-invariant
and time-dependent errors. Random errors of approx 2% net arise
from instrument noise, digitization, atmospheric temperature and
retrieval errors. Time-invariant errors occur due to Rayleigh
scattering, wavelength and radiometric calibrations, retrieval
error (all of order &lt;1%) and the ozone absorption cross-section
(&lt;3%). Time-dependent errors are due to radiometric and wavelength
calibrations (&lt;0.1 and &lt;0.02 %/yr respectively), atmospheric
temperature (0.16%/K) and tropospheric ozone (0.05%/% change).</P>

<P>All values expressed here are typical and may not be representative
under extreme conditions. In all cases, the uncertainty in total
ozone depends on the wavelengths used, the uncertainty in the
measurement at those wavelengths and the sensitivity of the retrieved
ozone to a change in albedo at that wavelength.</P>

<P>The time-invariant errors due to Rayleigh scattering and absorption
cross-section coefficients arise through errors in the laboratory
measurements used to determine these values. These are values
required for the calculation of the scattering of atmospheric
radiation by ozone. Errors propagate through the retrieval algorithm
to produce a systematic offset.</P>

<P>The Nimbus-7 TOMS instrument was in orbit for 15 years, during
which time the instrument sensitivity changed significantly. NASA's
Ozone Processing Team has devoted considerable effort to understanding
these changes, which account for about 1% per decade change in
the instrument calibration.</P>

<P>Differences between the actual vertical distribution of ozone
and the standard profiles can contribute to significant random
errors at high solar zenith angles. Thus, the combination of long-term
decreases in ozone at high altitudes and a drift in the Nimbus-7
orbit that resulted in a small increase in SZA, can lead to systematic
errors up to -5%/decade in Version 6 TOMS data at latitudes greater
than 70 deg. during Northern hemisphere winter. In lower latitudes,
the seasonal trend is estimated to be less than 2%/decade.</P>

<P>No detectable change with time has been found in the Nimbus-7
TOMS wavelength scale. The upper limit for the possible change
is 0.02%/year.</P>

<H3><A NAME="Localised"></A>3.3 Problems localised in space and
time</H3>

<P>Volcanic SO2 and aerosol contamination prevented TOMS from
accurately measuring total ozone when volcanic clouds were present,
prior to the development of an algorithm to detect the presence
of sulphur dioxide. Since this algorithm was developed over 100
eruptions have been detected and measured, the most notable being
El Chichon in 1982 and Mt. Pinatubo in 1991. Values that are flagged
for SO2 contamination are not used to calculate grid means, since
the error in the ozone values can be as high as 50DU.</P>

<P>Other localised problems include scan angle dependence (of
the order 1%, rising to 2% if there is sun glint), solar eclipses
(when no ozone values are retrieved due to the decrease in solar
irradiance), the presence of polar stratospheric clouds which
can lead to total ozone being underestimated at solar zenith angles
greater than 70 degrees, and high terrain. <HR ALIGN=LEFT><A

<H2>4. Transferring TOMS data from the BADC</H2>

<P>You can obtain copies of TOMS ASCII data files via this WWW
server, or via the BADC ftp service on <EM>ftp.ceda.ac.uk</EM>.
For the inexperienced user, help is available on <A HREF="/help/ftp_guide.html">how
to use FTP (File Transfer Protocol)</A>. The daily data files
are relatively small (approx. 170 kilobytes) and easy to transfer.</P>

<H3><A NAME="Directory"></A>4.1 Finding the data directory for
FTP</H3>

<P>After logging in, <EM>cd /badc/toms</EM>
to reach the top of the TOMS directory tree. You will then see
the data and software directories. The ASCII data files are in
subdirectories for all four TOMS satellites below the <EM>data</EM>
directory. (These subdirectories contain further subdirectories
for the processing version and year).</P>

<P><STRONG>GIF images</STRONG> can be found in the <EM>images</EM>
directory, where there are some sample files and subdirectories
for northern and southern hemisphere plots. A full set of plots
for the two hemispheres is currently held online, although these
may be removed if there is pressure on disk space in the future.
The IDL code used to plot the sample files is available in the
<EM>3rdparty</EM> software directory.</P>

<H3><A NAME="File"></A>4.2 File names</H3>

<P>The GIF image files also use the <EM>yymmdd</EM> date convention,
as follows:</P>

<P><EM>satyymmddh.</EM>gif</P>

<P>where <EM>sat</EM> = satellite, but the 3-letter code above
is replaced by a 1-letter code<BR>
<EM>h</EM> = hemisphere ('n' or 's') for north or south, e.g.
