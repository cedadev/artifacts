<HR ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
The BADC holds AAM data in ASCII files. These files are supplied
by the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF)
and the Met Office. File names
are detailed in the <A HREF="aamhelp.html#name">Help file</A>.

<H3>Temporal coverage</H3>

<UL>
  <LI>ECMWF data spans 1979 to 1993, with data at 24 hourly intervals.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Met Office data are available from 1983 to the present. The Met Office
  data consists of three subsets:<BR>
<BR>
  <OL>
    <LI>Data prior to 1st November 1986 in Met Office format (24-hourly intervals).
    <LI>Data after 1st November 1986 in Met Office format (12-hourly intervals).
    <LI>Washington-coded data for dates after 1st November 1986 (12-hourly
    intervals).
  </OL>
</UL>

<H3>Parameters stored</H3>

<P>The parameters stored in the ECMWF and most recent (after 1st
November 1986) Met Office files are the same, namely (for each time
interval stored):

<PRE> 
   X1PN, X1PS, X1WN, X1WS
   X2PN, X2PS, X2WN, X2WS
   X3PN, X3PS, X3WN, X3WS</PRE>

<P>where:

<UL>
  <LI>X - to be read as chi
  <LI>1/2/3 represent the AAM component:
  <OL>
    <LI>component with rotation axis aligned with greenwich meridian;
    <LI>&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 90&deg;East;
    <LI>&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; principal axis
    of earth's inertia tensor. n.b. X3 has the opposite sign to X3
    as defined in BHWW (1983) (5.3) and Hide (1984) (a3) (see <A 
    HREF="references.html">references</A>);
  </OL>
  <LI>P/W indicates pressure (also called matter) or wind term.
  This is calculated using only the part of the atmosphere between
  1000 mb and 50 mb.
  <LI>N/S represents Northern or Southern hemisphere.
</UL>

<P>The early Met Office data contains global wind and pressure terms
rather than separate components for each hemisphere and includes
an additional &quot;total&quot; term (P+W). The situation can
be summarised as follows:

<PRE>
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|     Dataset           |      Pressure       |      Wind           |  P+W  |
|                       |---------------------|---------------------|       |
|                       | North | South | N+S | North | South | N+S |       |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Met Office pre Nov. 86 |   -   |   -   |  Y  |   -   |   -   |  Y  |   Y   |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Met Office post Nov. 86|   Y   |   Y   |  -  |   Y   |   Y   |  -  |   -   |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|     ECMWF             |   Y   |   Y   |  -  |   Y   |   Y   |  -  |   -   |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|</PRE>

<P>where &quot;Y&quot; denotes that a term is present and &quot;-&quot;
denotes that term is absent (for all three components X1, X2,
X3).<BR>
<BR>
In addition, Met Office data post-Nov. 1986 is stored at 12-hourly intervals
(earlier data and ECMWF data are 24-hourly). </blockquote>
