<P>For about a century, the rotation of the Earth has been known
to vary by small but measurable amounts. Some of the observed
changes have long been recognised as being due to the exchange
of angular momentum between the solid Earth and the atmosphere.
With the advent of modern astronomical techniques and global atmospheric
analyses it has become possible to make detailed assessments of
the extent to which fluctuations in AAM are responsible for the
observed changes in the length of the day (LOD) and instantaneous
position of the Earth's pole of rotation.

<P>AAM and its effect on the Earth's rotation is important for
a variety of reasons. Geophysicists would like to be able to allow
for the atmosphere's contribution to the Earth's motion so that
they can study other effects, such as that of the Earth's liquid
core. Atmospheric analyses and forecasts may also be used to improve
the determination and prediction of changes in the Earth's orientation
in space, which is of increasing importance to the space agencies.
Finally, fluctuations in AAM can give information about the large
scale behaviour of the atmosphere. <BR>

<H3><A NAME="intro"></A>Introduction</H3>

<P>Angular momentum is a three-dimensional quantity that in the
absence of external torques is conserved: it is therefore a fundamental
measure of the state of any closed system. Numerous studies have
examined the balance of angular momentum within the earth system,
involving all parts of the planet, including its atmosphere, oceans,
solid shell (crust and mantle), and core. It is the atmosphere,
though, that is most variable, exchanging relatively large proportions
of its momentum with the solid earth below, compared with the
other components. Indeed, on a wide range of time scales between
several days and years, considerable agreement exists between
changes in the angular momentum of the atmosphere and those of
the solid earth, which are evident as small but important changes
in the rotation of the planet.

<P>Variations in the axial component of the earth orientation
vector, and hence the rotation rate, are reckoned by geodesists
as variations in &quot;universal time,&quot; or its derivative,
the length of day (LOD). Variations in its two equatorial components
indicate movements in the position of the earth's pole relative
to its crust, a wobble of the planet. Historically, both LOD changes
and polar motions were determined from conventional astronomical
measurements. In recent years, however, a number of sophisticated
space geodetic techniques have supplanted the older optical methods
to produce well-resolved and highly accurate values of earth orientation.
The scientific need for monitoring changes in earth rotation relates
to understanding a number of geophysical processes involving the
planet's interior structure, as well as its enveloping oceans
and atmosphere. Precise knowledge of the earth's orientation is
also important for purposes of navigation, especially in the tracking
of interplanetary spacecraft.

<P>It has been recognized since at least the time of <A HREF="references.html#Starr1948">Starr
(1948)</A> that the angular momentum of the atmosphere need not
remain constant and that exchanges with the underlying planet
can occur. The variable nature of atmospheric momentum indicates
that momentum transfer is intimately linked to the subtle changes
that occur in the earth's orientation. The topic of the earth's
variable rotation has been reviewed in a number of comprehensive
books and papers including those of <A HREF="references.html#Munk1960">Munk
and MacDonald (1960)</A> and <A HREF="references.html#Lambeck1980">Lambeck
(1980)</A>, who provide a theoretical basis as well as earlier
observational evidence of various forcing terms. <A HREF="references.html#Oort1989">Oort
(1989)</A>, <A HREF="references.html#Hide1991">Hide and Dickey

recent geophysical views and results using modern observing systems.

<H3><A NAME="eaam"></A>The Effective AAM (EAAM) functions</H3>

<P>A formal derivation of the dynamic relation between the atmosphere
and solid earth was developed by <A HREF="references.html#Barnes1983">Barnes
et al (1983)</A>. Their expressions for the atmospheric excitation
functions for changes in earth orientation involve both motion
terms represented by volume integrals of winds (W), and mass terms,
represented by surface integrals of pressure (P).

<P>The three EAAM functions (X1, X2, X3 - here X should be read
as <EM>chi</EM>) formulated by <A HREF="references.html#Barnes1983">Barnes
et al (1983)</A>, can be regarded as the components of the atmospheric
angular momentum (AAM) vector. To be more precise, they form a
pseudo-vector because the equatorial components of AAM are multiplied
by C / (C - A) to form X1 and X2 (where C is the polar moment
of inertia of the whole earth and A is the corresponding equatorial
moment of inertia). Their formulation includes Love numbers which
paramterize the effect of the lack of rigidity of the Earth on
its response to atmospheric forcing.

<P>The first two functions, X1 and X2, are the equatorial components
and are associated with the excitation of polar motion. The axial
component X3 is associated with changes in LOD. The formulas relating
earth-orientation parameters and these excitation terms are described
in detail in <A HREF="references.html#Barnes1983">Barnes et al
(1983)</A>. Briefly, the equatorial relationships involve a transfer
function between pole position and its two excitation terms X1
and X2 consisting of a convolution with the earth's free mode
(a strong oscillation in polar motion with a 14-month period,
discovered by Chandler in the nineteenth century). Less complicated
is the axial relationship, in which changes in LOD are merely
proportional to the excitation X3.

<H3><A NAME="var"></A>Time variations in the AAM components</H3>

<P>Significant variations in all three components of the excitation
functions occur on many scales. The axial component, X3w, proportional
to the relative atmospheric angular momentum due to zonal winds,
varies by as much as 100% seasonally, essentially doubling between
Northern Hemisphere summer and winter due to the strong annual
cycle of the jet stream in that hemisphere. The resulting change
between seasonal extremes in LOD can be as much as 2 ms (<A HREF="references.html#Rosen1983">
Rosen and Salstein 1983</A>). Furthermore, X3w is well correlated
with LOD on time scales varying between several days and years
( <A HREF="references.html#Rosen1990">Rosen et al 1990</A>; <A
HREF="references.html#Dickey1992b">Dickey et al 1992b</A>). (The
X3P term, related to meridional transports of mass that change
the atmosphere's polar moment of inertia, appears to be of lesser
importance than the X3w term on most time scales.) Shorter, intraseasonal
momentum fluctuations on the 40-60-day time scale are mirrored
in the LOD signal as well ( <A HREF="references.html#Langley1981">Langley
et al 1981</A> ). Changes in LOD on longer, interannual time scales
have been related to the El Ni&amp;ntildeo-Southern Oscillation
phenomenon, due to the strong wind anomalies associated with ENSO
events (e.g., <A HREF="references.html#Salstein1986">Salstein
and Rosen 1986</A>; <A HREF="references.html#Dickey1992a">Dickey
et al 1992a</A>). Some evidence also exists for a signal of the
stratospheric quasi-biennial oscillation in the LOD series ( <A
HREF="references.html#Chao1989">Chao 1989</A>).

<P>With regard to the equatorial components of earth orientation,
the strongest signal contains variations on the order of 10 m
in pole position, occurring at the resonant 14-month Chandler
period, but a suitable explanation for its maintenance against
dissipation is not yet available. In contrast, shorter variations
of polar motion have been more clearly identified with specific
geophysical causes. Earth wobble has a strong annual component
associated in part with both groundwater storage and the atmosphere
( <A HREF="references.html#Kuehne1991">Kuehne and Wilson 1991</A>;
<A HREF="references.html#Chao1988">Chao 1988</A>). On intraseasonal
time scales, motions of the pole occur with a magnitude of about
60 cm. The evidence for atmospheric pressure forcing of these
rapid polar motions is strong ( <A HREF="references.html#Eubanks1988">Eubanks
et al 1988</A>) and contributions from wind may play a role as
well ( <A HREF="references.html#Gross1992">Gross and Lindqwister
1992</A>).

<H3><A NAME="ocean"></A>Effects due to the oceans</H3>

<P>The degree to which changes in the mass distribution of the
global ocean impact LOD changes and polar motion is an important
unknown. A zero-order approach to dealing with the problem is
to not involve the ocean at all by assuming it rigid. A relatively
simple alternative is to assume a state of static ocean equilibrium
with the overlying atmosphere, the so-called inverted barometer
(IB) hypothesis ( <A HREF="references.html#Gill1973">Gill and
Niiler 1973</A>). Simply stated, under IB conditions, any change
in air mass over the ocean will depress the water surface below
areas of high atmospheric pressure and raise sea level beneath
low pressure areas. The ocean water so displaced has the same
mass as that part of the atmosphere greater than its mean value
over the ocean, with an approximate equivalence of 1 mb of atmospheric
pressure to 1 cm of sea level. Because of oceanic mass redistribution
under IB conditions, the solid earth below the ocean will not
be affected by local changes of atmospheric pressure, but rather
by the mean change of surface air pressure over the entire ocean.
The sensitivity of the pressure excitation terms to the introduction
of an IB model is comparable to the terms themselves; however,
the degree to which the IB response occurs, and reduces the importance
of the pressure variations over the ocean, is still under investigation.
Therefore, it has become the general practice to calculate the
excitation terms assuming both a non-IB and a pure IB response
of the oceans. In fact, though, some sort of dynamic, intermediate,
ocean response to variation in atmospheric pressure is perhaps
most likely and the object of current research using both analytic
means ( <A HREF="references.html#Dickman1988">Dickman 1988</A>)
and modelling approaches (<A HREF="references.html#Ponte1991">
Ponte et al 1991</A> ). </ol>
