<h1>
FAAM Flight Data File Names
</h1>
<hr>

<p>
FAAM data file names follow the
<a href="/help/file_naming.html">BADC File Name Convention</a>
with a number of additional specific constraints listed below.
</p>
<p>
The file name structure since June 2007 is as follows:
<br><br><center><i>
DataID _ Platform _ Date _ [ Version# ] _ Revision# _ Flight# [ _ Extra ] . extension
</i></center></br>
or, more precisely:
<br><br><center><i>
<b>dataID _ faam _ YYYYMMDD [ _ v# ] _ r# _ fxxx [ _ extra ].ext</b>
</i></center></br>
where elements in square brackets are optional.
Note that the file name is made of 5 mandatory and 2 optional fields
separated by underscore signs, plus a file extension separated from
the file name body by a dot.
Letters appearing in the various fields must be lower case characters.
The different fields represent the following variables, with the
following syntax.
<ul>
<li>


<u>DataID</u> 
identifies the data stored in the file. It can be the
name of an instrument, of a group of instruments, of the physical
quantity measured by an instrument.
This field has the value <i><b>core</b></i> for files containing
processed data issued from the set of core instruments flown on a
particular flight.
In some instances, non-core data can also be merged into single files,
in which case <i>dataID</i> will have a value referring to all merged
non-core data.
Note that the <i>dataID</i> parameter is called <i>instrument</i> in
the <a href="/help/file_naming.html">BADC File Name Convention</a>.
Only values of <i>dataID</i> belonging to the
<a href="/filespec_doc?id=INSTRUMENTAL&hfile=1#Instrument">BADC
list of standard instrument names</a>
will be accepted by the file uploader.
If you are a data provider and can't find an adequate value in the list,
please contact the
<a href="mailto:badc@rl.ac.uk">BADC</a>.
<li>
<u>Platform</u>.
The second field (the platform name) must be <i><b>faam</b></i>
for data collected aboard the FAAM aircraft.
<li>
<u>Date</u>.
The third field is the date, in the format
<i>YYYYMMDD</i> (Year <i>YYYY</i>, Month <i>MM</i>, Day <i>DD</i>).
If required, this can be completed by an indication of time, using 2-digit 
numbers <i>hh</i> (hour), <i>mm</i> (minutes), <i>ss</i>
(seconds). The additional [hhmmss] is currently used for dropsonde data.
<li>
*<u>Version</u>.
<i><b>r</b>#</i> (lower case <i><b>v</b></i> followed by an 3-digit integer
greater than or equal to 0) is version number of the processing software
<i><b>v001</b></i> stands for the initial version. This was first introduced in June
2007 when the processing software was transferred to a LINUX system. Not all file
types include this number. 

<li>
*<u>Revision</u>.
<i><b>r</b>#</i> (lower case <i><b>r</b></i> followed by an integer
greater than or equal to 0) is the revision of the flight constants 
(eg improved calibrations constants).
<i><b>r0</b></i> stands for the initial version, <i><b>r1</b></i>
for the first revision, etc.
<li>
<u>Flight</u>.
<i>fxxx</i> is the flight number.
It is made of a lower case letter followed by a 3-digit integer.
For example, all FAAM flights from March to October 2004 are numbered
<i><b>b001</b></i> to <i><b>b056</b></i>.
<li>
<u>Extra</u>.
The <i>extra</i> field is optional and is provided to account for
any useful piece of information not covered by the previous 5 fields.
Raw data may be distinguished from processed data in this way, although
the file name extension (see below) will usually provide a sufficient
indication on whether the data is raw or processed.
<i>extra</i> may include underscore signs (in other words, <i>extra</i>
could be more than one subfield).
<li>
<u>Extension</u>.
<i>ext</i> is an indication of the file format.
A list of accepted
<a href="/filespec_doc?id=INSTRUMENTAL&hfile=1#Extension">file
name extensions</a> is provided.
Please contact the <a mailto:"badc@rl.ac.uk">BADC</a> if the list must
be updated to account for a new format (in particular, for raw data
produced in an instrument-specific format).
</ul>
</p>

<p>
*Users are advised that more than one revision of the data may be present in
any flight directory due to reprocessing using improved software or calibration
coefficients.   In the absence of specialist advice, users are always  
advised to use the latest revision of the highest version of data in the archive.
