<h1>
FAAM Flight Data File Names
</h1>
<hr>

<p>
FAAM data file names follow the
<a href="/help/file_naming.html">BADC File Name Convention</a>
with a number of additional specific constraints listed below.
</p>
<p>
The file name structure is as follows:
<br><br><center><i>
Field 1 _ Field 2 _ Field 3 _ Field 4 _ Field 5 [ _ Field 6 ] . extension
</i></center></br>
or, more precisely:
<br><br><center><i>
dataID<b>_faam_</b>YYYYMMDD[hh[mm[ss]]]<b>_r</b>#<b>_</b>fxxx[_extra].ext
</i></center></br>
where elements in square brackets are optional.
Note that the file name is made of 5 mandatory and 1 optional fields
separated by underscore signs, plus a file extension separated from
the file name body by a dot.
Letters appearing in the various fields must be lower case characters.
The different fields represent the following variables, with the
following syntax.
<ul>
<li>
<u>Field 1</u>.
<i>dataID</i> identifies the data stored in the file. It can be the
name of an instrument, of a group of instruments, of the physical
quantity measured by an instrument.
This field has the value <i><b>core</b></i> for files containing
processed data issued from the set of core instruments flown on a
particular flight.
In some instances, non-core data can also be merged into single files,
in which case <i>dataID</i> will have a value referring to all merged
non-core data.
Note that the <i>dataID</i> parameter is called <i>instrument</i> in
the <a href="/help/file_naming.html">BADC File Name Convention</a>.
Only values of <i>dataID</i> belonging to the
<a href="/filespec_doc?id=INSTRUMENTAL&hfile=1#Instrument">BADC
list of standard instrument names</a>
will be accepted by the file uploader.
If you are a data provider and can't find an adequate value in the list,
please contact the
<a href="mailto:badc@rl.ac.uk">BADC</a>.
<li>
<u>Field 2</u>.
The second field (the platform name) must be <i><b>faam</b></i>
for data collected aboard the FAAM aircraft.
<li>
<u>Field 3</u>.
The third field is the date, in the format
<i>YYYYMMDD</i> (Year <i>YYYY</i>, Month <i>MM</i>, Day <i>DD</i>).
If needed, this can be completed by an indication of time, where any
of the 2-digit numbers <i>hh</i> (hour), <i>mm</i> (minutes), <i>ss</i>
(seconds) can be omitted provided that the next ones are also omitted.
<li>
<u>Field 4</u>.
<i><b>r</b>#</i> (lower case <i><b>r</b></i> followed by an integer
greater than or equal to 0) is the data revision number.
<i><b>r0</b></i> stands for the initial version, <i><b>r1</b></i>
for the first revision, etc.
<li>
<u>Field 5</u>.
<i>fxxx</i> is the flight number.
It is made of a lower case letter followed by a 3-digit integer.
For example, all FAAM flights from March to October 2004 are numbered
<i><b>b001</b></i> to <i><b>b056</b></i>.
<li>
<u>Field 6</u>.
The <i>extra</i> field is optional and is provided to account for
any useful piece of information not covered by the previous 5 fields.
Raw data may be distinguished from processed data in this way, although
the file name extension (see below) will usually provide a sufficient
indication on whether the data is raw or processed.
<i>extra</i> may include underscore signs (in other words, <i>extra</i>
could be more than one subfield).
<li>
<u>Extension</u>.
<i>ext</i> is an indication of the file format.
A list of accepted
<a href="/filespec_doc?id=INSTRUMENTAL&hfile=1#Extension">file
name extensions</a> is provided.
Please contact the <a mailto:"badc@rl.ac.uk">BADC</a> if the list must
be updated to account for a new format (in particular, for raw data
produced in an instrument-specific format).
