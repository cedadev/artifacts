FAAM Data Types
</h1>

<hr>

<p>
The apparatus that can be flown onboard the BAE-146 aircraft include a large
variety of
<a href="http://www.faam.ac.uk/public/instrumentation.html">instruments</a>,
that can be fit onto the aircraft to meet the mission goals.
<a href="http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/faam/doc/FAAM_Instrument_Metadata">
Instrument specifications</a> can be found in the
<a href="http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/faam/doc/">
FAAM Documentation</a> archive.
The measurements, accompanied by extensive metadata, include
meteorology, cloud physics and chemical composition data, as well as
parameters required for aircraft navigation.
</p>

<p>
The FAAM flights include
<ul>
<li><b>Test or calibration flights</b>
    to test the aircraft operations and the scientific equipment.
    Data generated during these flights are permanently restricted
    to the group of scientists involved in the test flights.
<li><b>Field campaign flights</b> supporting research projects.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The above two types of flights generate data and metadata that are further
subdivided into the following categories.
<ul>
<li><b>Flight logs.</b> In PDF format.
    Campaign flight logs are publicly available.
<li><b>Flight constants</b> needed to process the raw core data.
    These are archived in text files alongside the raw core data (see below)
    and are restricted to FAAM instrument operators.
<li><b>Quick look data.</b> Text files containing data requested by the
    instrument operators and available at the end of each flight.
    Restricted to FAAM staff.
<li><b>Core data</b>.
    These data are produced by instruments which have been recognised as "core"
    instruments by the FAAM Board.
    Core instruments are defined in the
    <a href="http://www.faam.ac.uk/public/instrumentation.html">List of FAAM
    instruments</a> and are operated by staff appointed by the FAAM.
    <ul>
    <li>
    <b>Raw core data</b> (i.e. data as they are produced by the instrument and in the
    format specific to the instrument) are restricted to the FAAM staff.
    <li>
    <b>Processed core data</b> from campaigns are available to all unless otherwise
    requested
    by the project principal investigator(s), in which case access to the
    data cannot be restricted for more than 12 months following the campaign
    last flight.
    A description (text) file is generally provided beside each processed
    core data file.
    </ul>
<li><b>Non-core data</b>.
    All data that are not core data.
    Non-core instruments are operated by the scientists who conduct the
    experiment.
    Access to non-core data from campaigns is ruled by the various programme
    protocols involved, which usually imply the release of the data to the public
    domain at some stage after a restriced access period of time.
</ul>
