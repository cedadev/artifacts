<H1>Met. Office Unified Model Naming Convention </H1>

<HR ALIGN=LEFT>

<H2><IMG SRC="/graphics/blue/info.gif" BORDER="0" ALIGN="BOTTOM">Introduction</H2>

<p>The Met Office are standardising the way their Unified Model should be referred to, and this page describes the changes</p>
<h2><IMG SRC="/graphics/blue/book.gif" BORDER="0" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> Statement from the Met Office </h2>
<p><U><strong>Met Office Model Naming</strong></U> </p>
<p>The wider use of the Met Office Unified Model outside   the Met Office and concerns about the identification of model configurations has   prompted a rethink about how we name our models. To be consistent with Met   Office's policies on brand management, the promotion of the Met Office and Met   Office Hadley Centre as part of the Met Office, please implement the following   changes with immediate effect. Licensing agreements with model users should also   specify this use of names.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Met Office Unified Model</strong> <BR>
  The Met Office Unified Model is a registered trademark.   The Met Office must be acknowledged   in any reproduction of data, publication of papers, reports, literature to   customers or presentations arising out of the use of the software using:   "Met Office Unified ModelTM   (UK)".<U></U></p>
<p><strong>MetUM</strong> <BR>
  "MetUM" may be used as a<em> subsequent</em> abbreviation of "Met Office   Unified Model" in any reproduction   of data, publication of papers, reports, literature to customers or   presentations arising out of the use of the Software .</p>
<p><strong>MetUM framework</strong> <BR>
  The umbrella name "Met Office Unified Model framework" or "MetUM   framework" should be used to cover model systems based around the use of the   Unified Model. This includes the UM atmosphere model (plus 4DVar, single column   model, etc), NEMO ocean model, CICE sea ice model, earth system components,   etc.</p>
<p>Within the MetUM framework we should distinguish   between:   
<UL>
  <LI><em>versions</em> which   describes code releases of each of the model components   
  <LI><em>configurations</em> which describes a specific combination of models at particular versions. <BR>
  </LI>
</UL>
<p><strong>Configurations of the MetUM framework</strong> <BR>
  Existing names (for example HadCM3, HadGEM2-ES,   HiGEM) can continue to be used to identify configurations of the MetUM framework   both internally and externally. Examples of how this should be used:</p>
<UL>
  <LI>In titles and abstracts of papers e.g. '&hellip; the latest   climate configuration of MetUM: HadGEM2-ES', '&hellip; the latest NWP configuration of   MetUM' or '&hellip; the latest Australian ACCESS configuration of MetUM' <BR>
  <LI>Within the body of the paper the configuration name   should be used e.g. HadGEM2-ES. <BR>
  <LI>Configuration descriptions should specify which   version of the individual components are used (eg, HadGEM2-AO is a configuration   of the MetUM framework; it comprises of UM atmosphere version 6.4 with   {<em>describe choices within that   version</em>} coupled to NEMO version 2 with   {<em>describe choices within that   version</em>}). <BR>
  </LI>
