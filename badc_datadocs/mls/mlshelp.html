<H2>1. The instrument</H2>

<P>This section contains a brief, simplified outline of the MLS
instrument and the measurement techniques which are employed.
Users requiring a more detailed description of the design and
operation of the instrument should consult the paper by Barath
et al. (1993).</P>

<H3><A NAME="InstDes"></A>1.1 Instrument Description</H3>

<P>MLS is a microwave radiometer which measures thermal emission
from the Earth's limb. Measurements of the emission spectra are
made in three channels at frequencies of 63 GHz, 183 GHz and 205
GHz, from which vertical profiles of mixing ratios, temperature
and pressure are derived.</P>

<P>The instrument observes the Earth's limb in a direction normal
to the orbital track. The tangent point (at the limb) is a great
circle distance of 23 deg. (approx. 2500km) away from the sub-satellite
track.</P>

<P>A 1.6m antenna receives radiation from the limb and is mechanically
scanned in the vertical every 65 seconds. The optics are diffraction
limited, giving a field of view of 3.5km (vertically) at the limb
in the 205 GHz channel. A switching mirror in the optical path
allows the instrument to accept radiation from the antenna, from
an internal calibration source or from cold space. This combination
allows an optimal calibration of the detectors.</P>

<P>A dichroic plate separates the signal to the 63 GHz channel
and this is followed by a polarization grid which isolates the
signals to the 183 GHz radiometer and to the 205 GHz radiometer.</P>

<P>In each channel, the incoming radiation is converted to intermediate
frequency bands in the 0-3 GHz range using local oscillators.
After amplification the intermediate-frequency signals are divided
into six spectral bands, each of which is further divided into
15 contiguous spectral channels by a bank of filters. The spectral
resolution of these channels is high enough to resolve emission
lines throughout the stratosphere.</P>

<H3><A NAME="MeasTech"></A>1.2 Measurement Techniques</H3>

<P>The six intermediate frequency bands are used to derive atmospheric
parameters from the atmospheric emission lines detailed below:</P>

<DL>
  <P>&nbsp;
  <DT><B>The 63 GHz channel</B>
  <DD>62.998 GHz and 63.569 GHz lines of O2. These lines are relatively
  temperature-insensitive, and by measuring the intensity and the
  line-width, the atmospheric pressure is derived. Differentiation
  with respect to the measured height differential also gives an
  indication of the temperature via the hydrostatic equation.
  <DT><B>The 183 GHz channel</B>
  <DD>183.310 GHz H2O and 184.378 GHz O3 lines. The intensity of
  these lines gives a measure of the abundance of the emitting
  gas
  <DT><B>The 205 GHz channel</B>
  <DD>204.352 GHz ClO, 206.132 GHz O3 and 204.575 GHz H3O2 lines
  in addition to a number of weak HNO3 lines. The intensity of
  these lines gives a measure of the abundance of the emitting
  gas.
</DL>

<H3><A NAME="Processing"></A>1.3 Data Processing</H3>

<P>The UARS data processing is carried out at the Central Data
Handling Facility at the Goddard Space Flight Center using software
supplied by the instrument's Principal Investigator group. The
data processing for UARS instruments consists of a progression
through a sequence of `levels' from the raw telemetry at level
0 to geophysical quantities interpolated onto standard grids at
level 3. The processing steps for MLS are outlined below:</P>

<DL>
  <P>&nbsp;
  <DT><B>Level 0-1</B>
  <DD>At the level 0-1 processing step, instrument-specific effects
  are removed and a set of calibrated data are derived in physical
  units (eg. voltages and radiances) tagged with their locations.
  <DT><B>Level 1-2</B>
  <DD>The level 1 data are then processed further to produce the
  level 2 product which contains vertical profiles of temperature,
  pressure and mixing ratios of chemical constituents at the measurement
  positions. The retrieval is based on the sequential estimation
  algorithm with an a priori estimate containing both the NMC daily
  analysis (when available) and a month-dependent, latitude-dependent
  climatology developed by the UARS science team.
  <DT><B>Level 2-3A</B>
  <DD>The level 2 data are profiles located at the measurement
  positions which are determined by the scan pattern and by the
  track of the tangent point. The level 2-3A processing step takes
  these data and interpolates them onto a standard set of vertical
  levels - evenly spaced in log pressure, and onto standard times
  (level 3AT) and standard latitudes (level 3AL). In the case of
  MLS, daily parameter files are also produced, containing data
  on the operation of the instrument which is not allowed by the
  standard level 3A file definition.

<H3><A NAME="Horizontal"></A>2.4 Horizontal Coverage</H3>

<P>The latitude coverage of the instrument alternates with the
yaw cycle of the satellite, which lasts approximately 36 days.
The coverage switches between 80 deg. S to 34 deg. N and 80 deg.
N to 34 deg. S at each yaw. The instrument observes the full range
of longitudes.</P>

<H3><A NAME="Temporal"></A>2.5 Temporal Coverage</H3>

<P>MLS began operations on the 11th October 1991 (UARS day 30)
and, at the time of writing, is still producing data. Since launch
there have been a number of periods during which data collection
has ceased, as tabulated below:</P>

<P>Note that the 183 GHz radiometer stopped operating on the 20th
of April 1993 (UARS day 587), and consequently there are no water
vapour (H3O) or Ozone (O3) data after this date.</P>

<P>After 2.3 years in orbit (in late December 1993), the antenna-scanning
mechanism began to exhibit signs of wear. March 1994 through May
1994, and July 1994 were periods of testing and significantly
reduced data gathering; these months have from one third of the
days with bad data to almost all bad days (days with no profiles
retrieved) October 1994 through January 1995 again have very few
days of useful atmospheric profile data. Very little limb data
gathering (typically only a few days per month) occurred from
February through July 1995, which was a period during which instrument
power sharing began for UARS (in May 1995). Since June 1995, MLS
has been in a mode of operation characterized by off periods for
power savings and on periods during which typically 2 days of
full (reverse) scans are obtained followed by one day of limb
tracking at altitudes near 18 km. The August 1995 through September
1996 time period generally contains about one half to one third
catalogued good days for atmospheric profiles, and this mode of
operation is expected to continue.</P>

<P>JPL's MLS instrument web pages include a complete set of <A
HREF="http://mls.jpl.nasa.gov/lay/um_calendars.html" TARGET="_top">MLS
calendars</A> showing the instrument's operational status on daily
basis for the entire mission.</P>

<P>Documents detailing the UARS satellite roll, yaw and orbit
adjustment manouevres are held in the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/mlsl3/doc/">BADC
documentation directory</A>.</P>

<H3><A NAME="VertRes"></A>2.6 Vertical Resolution</H3>

<P>The UARS level 3A data are interpolated onto a standard set
of pressure levels which are evenly spaced in log pressure. There
are 6 levels per decade in pressure given by the following relation:</P>

<PRE>    p = 1000x10(-i/6)   [i=0, 1, 2, ...]</PRE>

<P>The retrieved vertical resolution is two UARS pressure surfaces
(delta log10(P) = 0.33, or about 6 km). The retrieved profiles
are represented as a piecewise-linear function with breakpoints
at alternate (even-numbered) UARS pressure surfaces (e.g. 10,
4.6, 2.2, 1 hPa). The data points on the even-numbered surfaces
(level 3AT files only) are the retrieved breakpoint values, while
those on the odd-numbered surfaces (e.g 6.8, 3.2, 1.5 hPa) are
averages of the temperatures on adjacent even-numbered surfaces.
The level 3AL profiles have an additional linear interpolation
with respect to latitude to generate an evenly spaced latitude
grid.</P>

<H3><A NAME="HoriRes"></A>2.7 Horizontal Resolution</H3>

<P>The level 3AT and level 3AL products differ in their horizontal
gridding. The 3AT products are interpolated along the tangent-point
track at standard output times corresponding to intervals of one
UARS Engineering MAjor Frame (1 EMAF = 65.536 s). This period
represents an along- track displacement of approximately 400 km
between measurements. The profiles are constructed by linear interpolation
in observation time from the level 2 profiles. The 3AL products
are interpolated onto positions defined by the intersection of
the tangent track with a latitude circle at standard 4 deg. latitude
intervals. <HR ALIGN=LEFT><A NAME="Quality"></A>Go to: [ <A HREF="#top">Contents</A>

<H2>3. Data Quality - General Considerations</H2>

<P>The information in this section was taken from the product
quality summary produced by the MLS team at JPL. The summary document
is available online from the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/mlsl3/doc/">MLS documentation
directory</A> at the BADC. The `quality' field in the level 3A
files is the retrieval's estimated uncertainty, includes random
and systematic components, and is obtained by propagating precisions
of the radiance measurements, estimates of constrained parameter
uncertainties, forward model inaccuracies, and some calibration
uncertainties through the retrieval software. The quality should
be interpreted as a lower bound on the accuracy. At the conclusion
of the retrieval, the estimated uncertainty is compared with the
<I>a priori</I> uncertainty. When the ratio is greater than 0.5,
or the temperature is more than 25% climatology, the quality is
set negative to flag the dependence of the retrieved temperature
on the <I>a priori</I>.</P>

<P>Values will appear in the profile vector in the data file whether
or not data were received from the instrument. These values are
a combination of <I>a priori</I> values (obtained from climatology
and contemporary NMC data) and instrument measurements. If no
instrument data are received, the retrieval relaxes to the <I>a
priori</I> and the estimated uncertainty values will all be negative.</P>

<P>In general, only data having <I>positive</I> quality values
should be used for scientific purposes. The level 3 parameter
files contain a diagnostic flag ` MMAF_STAT' which gives information
on whether each major frame has good data, no data, or bad data.
For optimal use of the data, the parameter files should be examined
and profiles with `MMAF_STAT' <I>not</I> set to `G', `T', or `t'
should be disregarded.</P>

<H2>4. Transferring MLS data from the BADC</H2>

<P>MLS data is held online in IEEE binary files, exactly as supplied
by the Goddard DAAC. Software from Goddard to read UARS binary
data is also supplied, as is 3rd party software written by other
users of the data.</P>

<H3><A NAME="Start"></A>4.1 Before you start</H3>

<P>You will need gzip installed on your local system to uncompress
the software packages - the source code is available from software
archives. You will also need to know <A HREF="/help/howtogetdata_gzip_and_tar.html">how
to use gzip and tar</A> once you have the files on your system
and <A HREF="/help/ftp_guide.html">how to transfer files via FTP (File
Transfer Protocol)</A> if you don't use the WWW interface for
transfers.</P>

<H3><A NAME="Files"></A>4.2 Transferring the files</H3>

<P>MLS data can be transferred via FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
or directly from these WWW pages. To use anonymous FTP, connect
to <I>ftp.ceda.ac.uk</I>. After logging in, <I>cd</I>
to <I>badc</I> to find the dataset directories, or <I>cd /badc/mlsl3</I>
to go directly to the MLS level 3 directory.</P>

<H4><A NAME="Finding"></A>4.2.1 Finding data and software files</H4>

<P>All MLS data and software is located beneath the directory
<I>mlsl3</I> Here you will find a README file and the following
subdirectories</P>

<UL>
  <P>&nbsp;
  <LI>data - contains the binary data files in subdirectories for
  constituent and year
  <LI>doc - contains MLS scientific documentation
  <LI>software - contains the read software and any 3rd party software
  available
</UL>

<P>The <A HREF="/data/uars/filenames.html">UARS file name convention</A>
will help you to work out which data files you need.</P>

<P>There are 2 level 3A data products for each MLS species per
day - one level 3AL and one level 3AT. Each version 4 product
file is accompanied by a &quot;meta&quot; file containing information
on the record length, which is required by the read software.
<STRONG>Make sure you pick up both the PROD and META files when
you transfer your data.</STRONG></P>

<UL>
  <P>&nbsp;
  <LI>The level 3AT files are a time ordered sequence of records
  each containing one profile, together with information on the
  position of the profile.
  <LI>The 3AL products are interpolated onto standard 4 degree
  latitude intervals at positions defined by the intersection of
  the tangent track with a latitude circle.
</UL>

<P>For each day there are two parameter files containing data
on the operation conditions of MLS which are not allowed by the
level 3AT/3AL file definition. There is a one-to-one correspondence
between records in the 3AT/3TP and 3AL/3LP files. For more detailed
information refer to the <A HREF="documents.html#inst_team_docs">level
3A file format documents</A>.</P>

<H3><A NAME="Software"></A>4.3 Using the read software on your
local machine</H3>

<P>The Goddard read software allows you to read the binary files
on a variety of UNIX systems using either C or FORTRAN (depending
on the patform - on SGI, HP and Sun machines both languages are
supported, on DEC only FORTRAN is supported).</P>

<P>Goddard supply the software in a tar archive compressed with
the UNIX compress facility. At the BADC we also hold a gzipped
version and the individual source files online. Unzip the software
files using the gzip -d command. Un-tar in a suitable directory
using the tar -xvf command. A makefile and README file are supplied
to help you build the code. The README file explains how to build
the code to suit your local operating system.</P>
