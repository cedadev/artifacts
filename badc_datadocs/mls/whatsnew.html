<P><EM>News on the BADC MLS service, MLS instrument and related
issues</EM> <HR ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<P><STRONG>29th Jan. 1998</STRONG>: The web pages have been reviewed
following the Version 4 update. Some broken links have been repaired
and the BADC MLS help file has been updated. Note that the definitive
source of information on MLS is the MLS team documentation.</P>

<P><STRONG>23rd Jan. 1998</STRONG>: The Version 4 MLS dataset
is now in place. The data is now in IEEE binary files, so the
read software is also changed. The documentation has also been
replaced. There is a new constituent, HNO3. The web pages and
README files are still to be fully updated.</P>

<P><STRONG>14th Jan. 1998</STRONG>: we are about to replace our
existing Version 3 MLS Level 3A data with Version 4. In the course
of this change we will also be updating the data <STRONG>directory
structure</STRONG>. The &quot;version&quot; subdirectory level
will be removed since we only keep the latest version online at
any given time. Beneath each species subdirectory we'll be adding
yearly subdirectories. The new data is in <STRONG>IEEE binary
files</STRONG> so we'll be holding it online as supplied (for
Version 3 we had to convert the supplied VMS binary files to ASCII
to allow users based on UNIX and other systems to read them).
The <STRONG>read software</STRONG> supplied with the files will
therefore also be different from Version 3.</P>
