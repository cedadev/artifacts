In 2007 the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology undertook continuation observational work as part of the DEFRA funded Acid Deposition Processes project. As part of this project data were collected a the Authencorth Moss field site near Edinburgh by a range of instruments routinely deployed at the site. In addition for this extension project the University of Manchester's 1290 MHz mobile wind profiler was deployed close to the Authencorth Moss field site to provide co-located vertical profiles of horizontal and vertical wind components as well as signal-to-noise (SNR) and spectal width measurements in January and February 2007.<p>

The Atmospheric Chemistry Studies in the Oceanic Environment (ACSOE) was a 5-year Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) programme on tropospheric chemistry coordinated by the University of East Anglia and involving research groups from a number of UK universities and research institutes. The project had three consortia of UK institutes and universities, each of which focused on a different scientific topic. OXICOA (OXIdising Capacity of the Ocean Atmosphere) was a study of oxidant, radical and related gas-phase chemistry in the clean and moderately polluted marine atmosphere. The Eastern Atlantic Spring/Summer Experiments (EASE 96 and EASE 97) were carried to collect data. The dataset includes measurements of the OH and HO2 radicals, measurements of halogen oxide radicals at Mace Head in conjunction with a survey of potential organic halogen source gases. In EASE 96 the Cranfield Jetstream aircraft was deployed to measure the vertical and horizontal homogeneity of the air mass.<p>

Data from observations made using  Chilbolton Facility for Atmospheric and Radio Research (CFARR).The Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) facility at Chilbolton Observatory, Hampshire (51.1445N, 1.4270W) is the home of many observation systems for meteorological and atmospheric science research. There are 4 radar systems designed to study precipitation, clouds and clear air, of which the largest is the 3 GHz Doppler radar (CAMRa) on the 25 m dish. There are also 4 lidar systems providing data on elastic backscattering, Doppler velocity, water vapour profiles and depolarisation. A wide range of meteorological and multiple raingauge data are available from both Chilbolton and the nearby Sparsholt field site. There is a wide range of radiometers at the site: microwave (for water vapour and liquid water measurements) and downwelling infra-red and visible detectors for radiation budget measurements. This dataset holds attenuation time-series data from vertically polarised 5 km links from South Wonston to Sparsholt. Cloud camera data from the Chilbolton site are available to provide visual information on weather conditions.

CFARR is funded by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) and is owned and operated by the Space Science and Technology Department of the STFC.<p>

This dataset consists of surface, tower and airbourne measurements of atmospheric chemistry and vertical wind profiles from the Coastal Air Pollution field campaign, led by Dr. Claire Reeves (University of East Anglia, UEA). Airborne measurements were made by instrumentation on board the Facility for Airborne Atmospheric Measurements's (FAAM) BAE 146 aircraft, with surface and tower measurements from the Weybourne Atmospheric Observatory (WAO) and the Facility for Ground-based Atmsopheric Measurements's (FGAM) 1290Mhz mobile wind profiling radar providing vertical profiles of winds, signal to noise ratios and spectral width data. These data were used to investigate the impact of local meteorology on coastal air quality and the structure and evolution of the coastal boundary layer. The objectives of the campaign was to: a) characterise the chemical composition of the air above and around WAO in various meteorological conditions to determine how representative the WAO observations are of the coastal region and of the air-mass origin (esp. in the case of maritime/Arctic air); b) determine the local flow patterns that can be established around WAO which may influence the redistribution of pollutants and to aid future identification of such patterns with the more limited vertical data that is routinely collected at WAO; c) identify patterns that decouple polluted layers from the surface; d) characterise the off-shore pollution sources (ship emissions, emissions from off-shore gas platforms) which impact measurements at WAO under maritime conditions; and, e) provide test cases for the one-dimensional MISTRA model of vertical profiles of trace components in the boundary layer and lower free troposphere, especially providing information about vertical exchange.<p>

The Convective and Orographically-induced Precipitation Study (COPS) was an international field campaign initiated by the German Research Foundation (DFG). The objective was to identify the physical and chemical processes responsible for the deficiencies in quantitative precipitation forecasting (QPF) over low-mountain regions with the goal of improving their model representation, and thus improve forecasts. For the field experiment, a region in southwestern Germany/eastern France was selected where severe thunderstorm activity is frequent in summer with significant amounts of precipitation and risk of flash flood events, while the skill of numerical weather forecasts in the region is particularly low. This dataset includes measurements of wind speeds and wind directions and aerosol concentrations.<p>

COBRA (impact of COmbined iodine and Bromine Release on the Arctic atmosphere) is a UK IPY (International Polar Year) consortium that aims to investigate the release mechanisms of iodine in the Arctic and the potential combined effects of iodine and bromine on its atmosphere. The team measured reactive inorganic halogens (BrO, IO, OIO, I2), O3, Hg, HOx, HCHO, NOx, VOCs and reactive halocarbons from temporary laboratories located on the eastern shore of Hudson Bay, north of Kuujjuarapik, during February-March 2008. Met balloons and O3 sondes were launched daily. COBRA set up an ice camp and flux chamber experiments ~500 m into the bay to directly measure halogen emissions and ozone deposition, and measured physical, chemical and biological characteristics of the sea-ice (and potentially of frost flowers) at different depths. The project is linked with OOTI, which carried out a simultaneous field experiment at Kuujjuarapik.<p>

The African Easterly Jet (AEJ) is part of a climatic system which is of critical importance to African and global weather and climate, but is poorly observed and not well represented in model analyses. For the JET2000 project the Met Office Met Research flight (MRF) aircraft performed four flights, involving transects along and across the jet and the baroclinic zone, to make observations of unprecedented resolution for this part of the world. 110 dropsondes were dropped along the fight path. The data includes detailed synoptic observations of the basic state over mainland West Africa, and detailed synoptic observations of the African Easterly Waves (AEW) over mainland tropical West Africa.<p>

The dataset contains colour images (shortwave/longwave/net radiation, albedo, clear-sky albedo, clear-sky shortwave/longwave/net radiation, and shortwave/longwave/net cloud forcing) from scanning radiometers on the three ERBE satellites and for combined satellite cases. Monthly average values are included for the time periods during which the scanners were operational. This dataset is public.<p>

This dataset contains radiances (from RAT), which are used to derive daily inverted profiles of temperature, and mixing ratios, water vapour, nitric acid, and nitrogen dioxide. Profiles are geolocated. Secondly, the LIMS Map Archival Tape (LAMAT). This dataset is processed to create daily maps in the form of Fourier coefficients for each parameter at 18 pressure levels (from 0.05 to 100 mbar). Data are organised into 38 4 deg. latitude bands. Data for the daily maps are interpolated to the two synoptic time (0000 GMT for night and 1200 GMT for day). Also included is the day/night combined (averaged) data. This dataset is public. Please note that a major reprocessing of the Nimbus 7 LIMS data has recently been completed. The purpose of this activity is to take advantage of the changes in the spectral line parameters that have occurred since the original archived version was created and to generate a data version that is compatible with the UARS data sets. Improvements in the algorithm have also been made. More information is available from the LIMS homepage at http://lims.gats-inc.com/ and version 6 data can be downloaded from GES DAAC.<p>

The project had three consortia of UK institutes and universities, each of which focused on a different scientific topic. The Aerosol Characterisation Experiment (ACE) aim was to determine and understand the properties and controlling factors of aerosol in the anthropogenically modified atmosphere of the North Atlantic, and to assess their relevance to radiative forcing. The data was collected as part of the HILLCLOUD-96 and 98 experiments, where a hill cap cloud which forms over a ridge on the north east of the island of Tenerife was used as a natural flow through reactor. The dataset contains the size distribution, size dependent chemical composition and hygroscopic properties of the marine and modified continental aerosol arriving at the North coast of the island.<p>

In Autumn 1995, the Goddard Distributed Active Archive Center (GDAAC) compiled the Climatology Interdisciplinary Data Collection (CIDC) to facilitate interdisciplinary studies related to climate and global change. This data collection has been produced in collaboration with the Center for Earth Observing and Space Research (CEOSR), Institute for Computational Sciences and Informatics (CSI), and George Mason University. It was designed for the study of global change, seasonal to interannual climate change, and other phenomena that require from one to dozens of interacting parameters. This CD set contains over 70 physical, monthly mean climate parameters from disciplines dealing with the atmosphere, land surface, ocean, cryosphere, biosphere, remote sensing science and the Sun. They have been gathered into one place and, where practicable, presented in a common format (monthly means with a 1 degree x 1 degree world grid, or commensurable resolution and 4-byte IEEE floating point words). Some small files are in ASCII. Twenty-five separate data sets are represented. Twelve of the datasets cover ten or more years. Greenhouse gases and global temperature variation data span over 100 years.<p>

The ERA-15 project produced a long time-series (January 1979 - February 1994) of consistent meteorological analyses using a single version of the ECMWF model. Dataset contains both initialised and uninitialised T106 spectral upper air data (approximately 1 degree resolution) on model levels and standard pressure levels. Corresponding surface parameters are held on a reduced gaussian N80 grid. Regular 2.5 degree x 2.5 degree gridded data is also stored on standard pressure levels and at the surface.<p>

Boundary conditions for LEM studies of contrail lifecycles will be delivered and Measurements of radiative forcing from spreading contrail taken for comparison to other cases. Case studies for testing later contrail cirrus parameterization in the Unified Model will be also be considered.<p>

The Continuum Absorption in the Visible and Infrared and its Atmospheric Relevance (CAVIAR) campaign will use instruments on board the Facility for Airborne Atmospheric Measurements (FAAM) BAe-146 aircraft to determine the strength and temperature dependence of the water vapour continuum over a range of wavelengths. In doing so, the aim is to determine whether water vapour dimers, or the far wings of monomer lines, or a combination of both, are responsible for the continuum absorption, and put the continuum on a more secure theoretical footing.<p>

This was achieved by pumping old air out of deep unconsolidated snow (known as firn) that accumulates to depths of around 50 to 100 m on the polar ice caps of both hemispheres. The resulting firn air samples from the Arctic and Antarctic were returned to Europe and the US for multiple gas and isotope analysis in a number of research laboratories. The firn air samples were analysed for well over eighty separate trace gases (halocarbons, non-methane hydrocarbons, alkyl nitrates, sulphur species, etc.), and thirteen different isotopic measurements of CO2, CH4, CO and permanent gases (O2, N2, Ar, Kr).<p>

Ground-based Automatic weather station (AWS), Radiosonde and British Antarctic Survey (BAS) Masin twin-otter aircraft data collected on and around the Antarctic Peninsula during the NERC-funded Orographic Flows and the Climate of the Antarctic Peninsula (OFCAP) project. 

The OFCAP project conducted an integrated programme of field observations, analysis and modelling aimed at understanding of how the westerly winds interact with the mountains of the Antarctic Peninsula and how those interactions control the climate of the eastern side of the Peninsula. This dataset comprises of data from the month-long intensive field campaign which took place in January 2011. During this period, atmospheric flow along a transect across the Antarctic Peninsula mountains around 67 degrees south was observed using the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) MASIN- Twin-otter instrumented aircraft and automatic weather stations at Avery Plateau, Cole Peninsula and North Adelaide Island along the line of the transect. Atmospheric conditions on the upwind (western) and downwind (eastern) sides of the mountains were measured using balloon-borne radiosondes were released from the Larsen Ice shelf camp and Rothera base. These observations were then analysed in conjunction with the results of high-resolution atmospheric model simulations in order to obtain a more complete picture of the flow across the Peninsula.

OFCAP was funded by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) for three years from Sept 2009 (NERC Reference: NE/G014124/1)<p>

The Airborne Arctic Stratospheric Expedition II (AASE II) which was based in Bangor, Maine between October 1991 and March 1992, with ER-2 flights from Ames Research Center, Fairbanks (Alaska), and Bangor; and DC-8 flights from Ames, Bangor, Anchorage (Alaska), Stavanger (Norway), and Tahiti, was a follow-up to an earlier AASE campaign in 1989. The dataset consists of measurements collected onboard the NASA ER-2 and DC-8 aircraft (for example, ClO, BrO, HCl, O3, NOx, N2O, HNO3, whole air samples and aerosol measurements). In addition, there are ozonesonde soundings from six Canadian stations, global grid point values of Nimbus 7 TOMS ozone, and selected radiosonde soundings from stations in the region of the experiment. Theory teams provided calculations of potential vorticity, temperature, geopotential, horizontal winds, parcel back trajectories, and concentrations of short lived species along the aircraft flight tracks; and northern hemispheric analyses of potential vorticity, temperature, geopotential, horizontal winds, and radiative heating rates.<p>

Data from observations made at the The Cape Verde Atmospheric Observatory (16.848N, 24.871W) which exists to advance understanding of climatically significant interactions between the atmosphere and ocean and to provide a regional focal point and long-term data. The observatory is based on Calhau Island of São Vicente, Cape Verde in the tropical Eastern North Atlantic Ocean, a region which is data poor but plays a key role in atmosphere-ocean interactions of climate-related and biogeochemical parameters including greenhouse gases. It is an open-ocean site that is representative of a region likely to be sensitive to future climate change, and is minimally influenced by local effects and intermittent continental pollution. The dataset contains mixing ratio measurements of Ozone, CO, ethane, propane, iso-butane, acetylene, iso-pentane, and halocarbons. Meteorological measurements (wind speed, wind direction, atmospheric pressure, air temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, rainfall) and aerosol concentrations are also contained in the data set. SOLAS (Surface Ocean / Lower Atmosphere Study) back trajectory images are also in this dataset: the Cape Verde Observatory was used during the SOLAS project.<p>

The Met Office have operated a network of wind profiling lidars at various sites around the British Isles since the first was installed in 1998, following the installation of the NERC MST radar near Aberystwyth. This datasets contains the available 30 minute averaged wind profile data from these sites made available for research by the academic community and included parameters such as measurements of the zonal, meridional and vertical components of winds, signal to noise ratio and spectral width. The data are from boundary layer UHF wind profilers located at Camborne (915 Mhz), Dunkeswell (1290 Mhz) and Wattisham (1290 Mhz) and a Stratosphere-Troposphere (ST) VHF radar at South Uist operating at 64 Mhz. A fourth UHF radar operated at 915 Mhz was operated at the NERC MST Radar site at Capel Dewi, near Aberystwyth, between November 1999 and March 2002; it was then relocated to South Uist until May 2005 ahead of and during the commisioning of the 64 Mhz radar, before being relocated to its present location on the Isle of Man. An additional Degreane wind profiler has since been purchased by the Met Office and is deployed at the Chilbolton Observatory, but data from this instrument are not presently part of this dataset. This dataset contains wind profiler data from Camborne (from 1998), Dunkeswell (from 1999), Wattisham (2001 to present), Aberystwyth (Capel Dewi, 1999 to 2002), South Uist (915MHz, 2003 to 2004), South Uist (64MHz, from 2004), and Isle of Man (2005 to 2008 and since 2010). Data from these wind-profilers, and from the NERC MST Radar, are used operationally by the Met Office for numerical weather prediction. They additionally receive data from up to another 15 wind-profiling systems throughout Europe as part of the CWINDE (COST Wind Initiative for a Network Demonstration in Europe) project. A map showing the locations of the wind profilers is available on the CWINDE website. Data from wind profilers is also routinely transmitted accross the Global Telecommunication System (GTS) according to standards defined by the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO). Those data can be found in the Met Office MetDB dataset also held by the BADC.<p>

As part of COPE, MICROSCOPE will improve predictions of severe convective rainfall by addressing the problem of the microphysics of precipitation in convective clouds. Data is being collected during the project over Cornwall and Devon, UK, during July and August 2013 to study the clouds. Three research aircraft (Facility for Airborne Atmospheric Measurements (FAAM) BAe146, Met Office Civil Contingency Aircraft (MOCCA) and University of Wyoming King Air), a ground-based radar and several other ground-based instruments are taking measurements of exactly how the rain forms and develops. The aircraft are equipped with instruments that can distinguish between liquid and solid particles at 200 mph, for example. A major objective is to find these needles in the haystack – the first few ice crystals that form in amongst the hundreds of cloud droplets per every cubic centimetre of cloud.<p>

The data were produced through international cooperation under the auspices of the international Atmospheric Circulation Reconstructions over the Earth (ACRE) initiative, and working groups of the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) and the World Climate Research Program (WCRP). The 20CR project produced comprehensive global atmospheric circulation data spanning from late 19th century to the early 21st century, having only assimilated surface synoptic pressure observations and using observed monthly sea-surface temperature and sea-ice distributions from the HadISST dataset, courtesy of the Met Office Hadley Centre, as boundary conditions. Analyses every 6 hours on a 2 degree grid were produced to give the most likely state of the atmosphere based on a 56 ensemble member runs. Means, spreads and all ensemble members for each time step are available in the dataset archived at the BADC. The current 20CR output produced spans from 1871 to present with the BADC copy being updated when possible.<p>

NOCS (National Oceanography Centre, Southampton) v2.0 is a monthly mean gridded dataset of marine surface meteorology and fluxes constructed using optimal interpolation using ship data only from ICOADS (International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set) v2.4. The dataset is presented as monthly mean values on a 1˚ area grid and each grid-box is characterised with estimates of random, bias and total uncertainty. The monthly mean dataset is calculated from daily estimates of each variable and the standard deviation of these daily values within each month is also presented.  Users are advised to take account of the uncertainty estimates provided in any analysis, and to note that in very poorly sampled regions, such as the Southern Ocean, the uncertainty estimates themselves may be unreliable.
Surface meteorological fields have been adjusted to account for varying measurement heights and for known biases. Surface fluxes have been calculated from daily fields of the surface meteorological parameters in the dataset using bulk parameterisations.
The NOCS v2.0 flux dataset was funded by the Oceans2025 project.<p>

RAPIT is looking at the problem of estimating the risk of the collapse of the overturning circulation. Using modern statistical methods for the analysis of complex numerical models, large ensembles of two Atmosphere Ocean General Circulation Models (HADCM3 and CHIME) will be analysed.

Studies of large excursions of the strength of the overturning in existing control runs will be used to guide our choice of metrics and diagnostics.

To produce the large number of model runs that are required for the statistical analysis, the climateprediction.net system will be used.<p>

Data from the operational NWP (Numerical Weather Prediction) output from the Variable resolution UK (UKV) part of the Met Office Unified Model. This latest configuration of the UM model has a high resolution inner domain (1.5 km grid boxes) over the area of forecast interest, separated from a coarser grid (4 km) near the boundaries by a variable resolution transition zone. This variable resolution approach allows the boundaries to be moved further away from the region of interest, reducing unwanted boundary effects on the forecasts. The UKV model is kept close to observations using 3D-Var data assimilation every 3 hours. This archive is currently being populated at the BADC.<p>

The project had three consortia of UK institutes and universities, each of which focused on a different scientific topic. The aims of the Marine Aerosol and Gas Exchange (MAGE) Eastern Atlantic Experiment were to quantify input of Dimethyl sulphide (DMS) into a parcel of air, examine the oxidation of DMS and its reaction with nitrogen species with time, investigate the formation of new particles as a results of these transformations, and to discriminate between natural and anthropogenic fractions of sulphur and nitrogen using isotopic measurements. Data contains profiles of aerosol size and distribution and trace gases throughout the marine boundary layer, taken using the British Aerospace Jetstream aircraft.<p>

The platform for data exchange will be a QUEST portal based on existing technology (following the NERC-ESSC GODIVA portal: http://www.nerc-essc.ac.uk/godiva). When the portal is finished, all archived QUEST data will be accessible through it. According to the QUEST data policy, all data become publicly accessible one year from acquisition.

The project will develop ways to assimilate the RAPID-WATCH and other ocean observations into ocean models which will then be used to produce ocean 'syntheses' - complete data sets of our best guess of past ocean state. Similar syntheses will also be produced which exclude the RAPID-WATCH observations.Both of these sytheses will then be used to start prediction experiments in climate models. By comparing the climate model simulations starting with and without the RAPID-WATCH observations, the impact of the the RAPID-WATCH array observations on climate predictions, and the climate model AMOC can be found.<p>

The improved understanding and seamless predictions will offer better estimates of the future frequency of high-impact, extreme climatic events and of the prediction uncertainty. New services to convey climate information and its quality will be used.

SPECS will be, among other things, the glue to coalesce the outcome of previous research efforts that hardly took climate prediction into account.

The MICROwave investigation of MIXed phase cloud (MICROMIX) project is a Facility for Airborne Atmospheric Measurements (FAAM) Campaign from late 2005, beginning of 2006, which aimed at testing and improving the representation of mixed phase clouds in radiative transfer models. The intention was to fly the FAAM BAE-146 aircraft in conjunction with the Chilbolton radar facility and ASMU overpasses in order to characterise the in-situ microphysics, spatial variability of the microphysics and the radiative properties respectively.<p>
