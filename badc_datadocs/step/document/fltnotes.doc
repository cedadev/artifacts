    Flight No. 4 - 16 January 1987 

    The first flight following the three ferry legs to Darwin was primarily 
    exploratory; 1) to overfly a large tropical cyclone and allow the pilot to 
    assess the possibility of in-anvil flight and 2) to test the accuracy of 
    short-range severe-weather prediction based on the radar display, storage
    and recycling capabilities of the RAPIC's installed at Darwin. 

    Cyclone Connie, located north of Broome, just off the coast of the 
    Kimberley Division, was moving slowly toward the southwest but within the
    ER-2 range.  The flight passed over several bands, oriented parallel to the
    wind, of active cumulonimbus clouds with turrets that were overshooting 
    into the stratosphere.  A descent was made into one of these collapsing 
    turrets and also the main anvil was penetrated just prior to the ascent to
    flight altitude and the return to Darwin. 

    Severe weather phenomena, including heavy rain showers and gusty surface 
    winds produced by the precipitation-induced downdrafts, were identified and
    tracked with the aid of the radar, with sufficient accuracy to permit 
    predictions for safe landing at Darwin during the lulls between storms.  
    However, during takeoff the ER-2 ascended in clouds and precipitation which
    exposed several instruments to too much water.  The excessive water was 
    outgassing for more than 2 hours, producing spurious H20 vapor measurements
    for about half the flight. 


    Flight No. 5 - 18 January 1987 

    A south-north flight to 30 S was selected both to complete the latitudinal 
    survey conducted during the ferry flights and to intercept air flowing out
    of the upper-level circulations produced by Cyclone Connie.  A vertical 
    descent-ascent profile was made at 30 S to intercept the descending, 
    anticyclonic trajectories of air leaving Cyclone Connie.  The vertical 
    profiles of potential temperature and trace gases measured at 30 S can be
    compared to those obtained two days earlier over the cyclone.

    Because Cyclone Connie maintained its intensity for several days, quasi 
    steady state conditions were sustained, eliminating a critical dependence
    on sampling the same air parcels at the initial and final points.  The 
    surface map included in this set, 1200 UT, 20 January 1987, illustrates the
    surprising persistence of the vortex even after it moved inland. 

    That the descent profile at 30 S was well placed to intercept the outflow
    from Connie is evident by the anticyclonically curved stream lines at 
    100 mb, OOOO UT, 19 January 1987. 


    Flight No. 6 - 22 January 1987 

    Cyclone Irma, which formed in the northern Gulf of Carpentaria, is evident
    in the surface map of the 20th, just south of Gove.  Flights to this 
    cyclone, while it was over the Gulf, were precluded by unfavorable cross-
    runway surface winds.  On the 22nd of January, favorable down-runway winds
    returned, but by this time the cyclone had travelled overland and was 
    weakening considerably.  The cyclone's upper level outflow, with dense 
    cirrus, was passing to the south of Darwin so a flight path perpendicular 
    to the flow was chosen, i.e., SSW-NNE flights.  The flights began at an 
    upper tropospheric level and progressively stepped up in altitude to 
    determine the characteristics of the clouds streaming from the cyclone, to
    determine their tops and their relationship to the water vapor. 

    Because the flights were close to Darwin, several flight levels could be 
    examined.  They produced a high resolution data set in and above cirrus
    clouds. 


    Flight No. 7 - 23 January 1987 

    Following the active period dominated by Cyclone Connie to the southwest of 
    Darwin and Cyclone Irma to the east and southeast, was a period of relative 
    calm with predominately clear skies.  Flight 7 was conducted in clear skies 
    over the Gulf of Carpentaria.  The objective here was to obtain 
    measurements in a cloud-free environment to test those theories that 
    depend on mean motions, and especially to test whether sub-visible cirrus 
    was, in fact, present. 

    After traversing the Gulf and on the return, the pilot was asked to turn 
    and head toward the southeastern edge of the Gulf to make measurements in a 
    cumulonimbus cloud cluster that was forming over the adjacent land.  An 
    extremely well-developed anvil had formed within the cluster, surrounded by 
    anvils more fibrous and irregular in shape.  Mechanical difficulties 
    prevented the pilot from reaching this well-developed anvil but he did 
    penetrate cirrus associated with overshooting turrets before returning to 
    Darwin. 

    Note that the clear air flight to the east from Darwin was directly 
    upstream, to the north of the major anticyclone centered about 15 degrees
    farther south.  Note also that the anticyclonic circulation extends over 
    the entire continent. 


    Flight No. 8 - 29 January 1987 

    This flight was designed to provide radiation measurements directly above
    the simultaneous measurements made by the NOAA P3 and the NCAR Electra. 
    The active area chosen was over the Joseph Bonaparte Gulf to the west, 
    northwest of Darwin.  Prior to the rendezvous time, the pilot made a series
    of flight maneuvers for the air motion system calibrations and made samples
    in the vicinity of collapsing turrets.  Enroute to the rendezvous point, 
    the inertial navigation system failed, so the pilot turned and returned to
    Darwin.  This failure would require another cooperative experiment to be 
    undertaken before the P3 and Electra departed.  Radiation measurements were
    the objective of Flight No. 10, the next coordinated flight mission. 


    Flight No. 9 - 31 January 1987 

    A cyclone developing again west of the Kimberlies provided active cloud
    bands in moderately strong maritime westerlies to the north of Darwin.
    Again a NNE-SSW flight path at several levels was selected to determine the
    cloud heights and water vapor distribution for meteorological conditions 
    under the influence of a tropical cyclone, but during its development, 
    Flight No. 6 was conducted during its dissipation.  However, in both cases
    the lower level flows are from the west and the upper level flows are from
    the east. 


    Flight No. 10 - 2 February 1987 

    Cyclone Damien was dominating the flow over the entire northern coast but 
    we had a commitment to obtain coordinated radiation measurements and 
    Damien was outside the other aircrafts' range, at least for the aircraft 
    based at Gove.  An active cumulonimbus cloud band located northeast of Gove
    was selected as the target. 

    The ER-2 was sent to the designated rendezvous point where detailed
    positioning was assigned by aircraft-aircraft communication.  While the 
    radiation survey was in progress, the inertial navigation system on the 
    ER-2 failed again.  The ER-2 was on its third flight altitude and the 
    pilot, Ron Williams, reported that the P3 had just completed its radiation
    flights. 


    Flight No. 11 - 3 February 1987 

    Having developed to cyclone intensity, Cyclone Damien was the subject of 
    this flight to the southwest of Darwin.  Confident of the extrapolated 
    position of the large cirrus anvil, I sent the ER-2 to a point along the
    SE edge and then requested a NW traverse of the anvil.  Upon completion of
    the traverse, the pilot was requested to turn left, descend and then, if 
    conditions were favorable, to make an orthogonal flight to the NE in the
    anvil.  At a specified point, the pilot was requested to ascend and fly
    over what appeared to be a band of convective turrets. 

    Extremely cold temperatures (-90 C) were encountered at the top of the 
    anvil and both the air motion system and the microwave radiometers 
    indicate that the lapse rate in the anvil was adiabatic.  Of particular 
    interest is the large concentrations of radon measured in the cirrus.  This
    radon emitted over the western Australian continent is advected over the
    ocean into the convective updrafts to the west and southwest of the 
    cyclonic vortex.  An excellent flight with extremely interesting data, this
    flight will merit special consideration. 


    Flight No. 12 - 8 February 1987 

    As Cyclone Damien weakened over the eastern Indian Ocean, an unprecedented 
    fourth cyclone developed (Cyclone Jason) once again over the northern Gulf
    of Carpentaria.  The high resolution inertial navigation system was 
    installed to determine whether an improved ventilation system would 
    eliminate the large temperature gradient thought to be responsible for 
    prior failure.  

    The flight was directed straight east of Darwin.  After passing over the 
    cirrus cloud shield, a right turn with descent was to be followed by a 
    traverse to the north, just skimming the tops of the cirrus.  After
    completing this traverse, another right turn would lead to a descent into
    the anvil. 

    During the first right turn and descent, a rising turret apparently 
    buffeted the ER-2, creating severe turbulence and large amplitude 
    oscillations of the wings.  The pilot increased altitude immediately and 
    then made the northward traverse with a series of steps to avoid the 
    anticipated turbulence. 

    After the second right turn the INS failed again but the wind measurements 
    obtained while it was working provide an excellent and unique description 
    of the flow field in the upper portions of a tropical cyclone. 


    Flight No. 13 - 10 February 1987 

    In the previous flights, the ER-2 was sent on horizontal flight legs, 
    either to a specified point where a vertical descent-ascent profile was 
    obtained, or an anvil penetration was attempted, or where the flight 
    direction was reversed at a new altitude.  On Flight 13. a completely 
    different approach was taken to provide more extensive altitude coverage.
    By flying a sinusoidal path up, down, up and down against the upper level
    flow and then repeating the up, down, up, down path on the return (but 180
    degrees out of phase). a criss-cross pattern was obtained. 

    Several scientists had proposed this type of flight but the pilot, Ron 
    Williams, said "Never again".  As the surface chart indicated, the first
    ascent took the ER-2 over Cyclone Jason where the extremely cold 
    temperatures were sustained long enough to freeze the controls, forcing Ron
    to recover manual control. 

    Although the low resolution INS was used, the accuracy of the horizontal 
    winds should provide a reliable description of the wind field for direct
    comparison with the radiosonde winds. 


    Flight No. 14 - 12 February 1987 

    The last flight from Darwin, prior to deployment to Moffett Field, was made 
    directly towards the east.  Cyclone Jason was still active over the Gulf of 
    Carpentaria - to the south of the flight path.  Cyclonically curved bands
    of cumulonimbus clouds - to the north of the flight path - converged toward
    the cyclone over the eastern Gulf of Carpentaria.  The pilot, James
    Barrilleaux, via radio communications requested permission to divert 
    slightly from the flight path to investigate these large cumulonimbus 
    clouds.  Permission was granted and Jim made several exploratory descent
    and ascent profiles, which as the tracer data indicates, include cirrus 
    penetrations, moist adiabatic lapse rates and measurable amounts of radon.
    Although these cumulonimbus clouds formed over the Arafara Sea, in maritime
    air, they definitely contain radon from a continental surface source. 

    On the return flight the pilot was instructed to fly over Melville and 
    Bathurst Islands where "Hector" was redeveloping.  Hector is a persistent 
    cumulonimbus cloud during transition to the summer monsoon, i.e., it forms 
    over the islands every afternoon.  Only a small version of Hector was noted 
    due to the strong low-level winds that carried the storms away from the 
    islands.
