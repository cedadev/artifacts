    README.DOC    November 1988
    

    1. Introduction

    The intention of this document is to inform you of the structure and format
    of the directories and files contained within this preliminary release, and
    some general information that may be useful for reading and interpreting
    the accompanying data files.  The exchange data files are for data collected
    onboard the NASA ER-2 during the 1987 Stratosphere-Troposphere Exchange 
    Project (STEP) based in Darwin Australia.  All files within this release 
    are standard ASCII files with variable length records.

    The DOCUMENT directory contains several files documenting the contents of
    this release.

        FORMAT.DOC    gives the format specifications which all experimenters
                      were encouraged to use when writing files for data
                      exchange.  The standard format includes header 
                      information which describes the data, and the data in the
                      form of time series.

        SOFTWARE.DOC  contains documentation on FORTRAN subroutines included 
                      in the SOFTWARE directory which can be used to read those
                      files which are in the standard format.

        CATALOG.DOC   contains a list of the principal investigators, their
                      instruments, and the available data.

        FLTNOTES.DOC  contains Edwin Danielsen's notes which briefly describe
                      the scientific objectives and meteorological context of
                      each of the ER-2 flights out of Darwin.

    The SOFTWARE directory contains several FORTRAN subroutines which can be
    used to read those data files which are in the standard format described
    in FORMAT.DOC.

    The data directories are organized by flight number (FLIGHT01, FLIGHT02,
    FLIGHT03, etc.) and contain all available exchange data files for a 
    particular flight.

    At the same time that the 1987 STEP was in progress there were two other
    major atmospheric experiments being conducted in northern Australia.
    These were the Australian Monsoon Experiment (AMEX) and the Equatorial
    Mesoscale Experiment (EMEX).  Both of these experiments utilized a
    variety of observation platforms including satellites, aircraft, radar,
    and radiosondes.
