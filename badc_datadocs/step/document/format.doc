    FORMAT.DOC     Format Specification for STEP Data Exchange Files

    1. File Organization

    1.1 Single file per flight.  If file exceeds disk size, the flight data 
        should be continued on subsequent disks, repeating the header 
        information, with incremented disk count.  The file names in such 
        cases should reflect that they are segments of the same flight file.

        Note: If the flight data must extend over more than one disk, 
              it will not be a single file in the PC or MS DOS sense, 
              but the subsequent file names should be the same with an 
              incremented file extension number.

    1.2 The file naming convention will consist of a two character identifier 
        (this could be initials of the measured quantity, or of the 
        experimenter, the latter being best when there are duplicate 
        instruments) and then the flight date.  The extension should have a 
        letter indicating the flight number for that day allowing for the 
        possibility of multiple flights in a day.  Finally there should be a 
        number indicating the sequence number for that flight's data, to allow
        for multiple disks required for a single flight.  In any event the 
        extension should be added to each file; if there is only one flight 
        and one disk the extension would be .A1.  Examples:

           SS870127.A1.........1st flight on Jan 27, disk no. 1
           SS870129.B1.........2nd flight on Jan 29, disk no. 1
           SS870205.A1.........1st flight on Feb  5, disk no. 1
           SS870205.A2.........1st flight on Feb  5, disk no. 2

    1.3 Required header info at the beginning of each file in specified format.


    2. Header Format

    2.1 Header should supply minimum required information in the format and 
        order specified in section 2.4.

    2.2 Additional information concerning the data may be added at the end of 
        the header segment, after the required information.

        Note: It has been requested that a note concerning the number 
              of significant figures which are reliable( since we are 
              recording scaled integers) be added. This note should be 
              contained in the header segment,  after the required
              information.

    2.3 The number of lines specified in the header should include any blank 
        lines up to the beginning of data.

    2.4 Required header information should appear in the order outlined below.

        Note: The line numbers are really record numbers since for a 
              large number of variables the scale factors and/or 
              missing values may require more than one line but are 
              read as one record.

        Line  1.  Number of lines in the header (including any blank lines).
        Line  2.  Experimenter name (last name first).
        Line  3.  Disk number; total disks for this flight (separated by a 
                  blank).
        Line  4.  Mission name.
        Line  5.  Date, entered as: YY MM DD (separated by a blank).
        Line  6.  Mission flight number; Lockheed sortie number (separated by 
                  a blank).
        Line  7.  Number of variables (Nv).
        Line  8.  Data sample interval, delta t, in seconds.
        Line  9.  Number of samples per time hack.
        Line 10.  Number of samples per line.
        Line 11.  Nv scale factor(s) for converting to engineering units (on 
                  one line separated by blanks).  The scale factor is the 
                  number by which one multiplies the integers on the disk file
                  to obtain actual engineering units.
        Line 12.  Nv missing value(s) for each recorded variable; this should 
                  be a number made up of as many 9's as it takes to fill the 
                  data field (on one line separated by blanks).  The missing
                  values should be larger than any good data values.
        Line 13.  Name var(1); eng units var(1).
        Line 13+1 Name var(2); eng units var(2).
        Line 13+2 Name var(3); eng units var(3).
                      .
                      .
                      .
        Line 13+(Nv-1). Name var(Nv); eng units var(Nv).

        Total number of required lines in the header = 13+(Nv-1).  Additional
        comments may follow the required lines.


    3. Data Format

    3.1 All data recorded as integer; the time hack can be written as integer 
        or real, depending on the experimenter's need for specifying the exact
        time of the measurement.

    3.2 Time in GMT elapsed time, cumulative across midnight.

    3.3 All data or data blocks are time tagged.

    3.4 Time gaps have data field filled with 9's.

    3.5 Data organization options.

        3.5.1 Time hack on each line (record) followed by data values at that 
              time, as follows: 

              time(1) A(1) [ B(1) C(1) ]
              time(2) A(2) [ B(2) C(2) ]
              time(3) A(3) [ B(3) C(3) ]

        3.5.2 Time hack on separate line followed by block of samples whose 
              first value pertains to time hack.  If multiple variables in 
              this option, the blocks are ordered by variable. 

              For single variable:

              time(1)
              A(1) A(2) A(3) A(4)
              A(5) A(6) A(7) A(8)
              time(9)
              A(9)  A(10) A(11) A(12)
              A(13) A(14) A(15) A(16)

              For multiple variables:

              time(1)
              A(1) A(2) A(3) A(4)
              A(5) A(6) A(7) A(8)
              B(1) B(2) B(3) B(4)
              B(5) B(6) B(7) B(8)
              time(9)
              A(9)  A(10) A(11) A(12)
              A(13) A(14) A(15) A(16)
              B(9)  B(10) B(11) B(12)
              B(13) B(14) B(15) B(16)


    4. Examples For File Headers

    4.1 Two examples of file headers are given below.  The line numbers 
        enclosed by square brackets are only for comparison with the header
        specifications given in section 2.4 and should not be included in the
        exchange files.  The second example shows that comments may be 
        included, if desired, after the required information.
