The decompression software provided on these CDs uses the UNIX
compression algorithm. It is provided for a wide variety of platforms
including Apple Macintosh, DEC VAX running VMS, and IBM PC compatibles
running MS-DOS. An IBM 386 and compatibles, or a Mac II and later
machine is recommended for improved performance when using these
two platforms. No special hardware is required to use this decompression
software. <BR>
