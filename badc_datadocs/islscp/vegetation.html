  <P>The basis for this data set is the Normalized Difference Vegetation
  Index (NDVI) data set calculated from AVHRR data by Los et al.
  (1994) following the work of Tucker et al. (1986). <BR>
<BR>
  These data were already in the form of a 1&deg; x 1&deg; monthly
  composited NDVI data set; i.e., no further single channel data
  or geometric information were available at the time. Some simple
  procedures were used to fill in gaps in the data set, and crude
  corrections were made to account for the effects of solar angle
  and persistent clouds to make the temporally and spatially continuous
  FASIR-NDVI product, see Sellers et al. (1994). <BR>
<BR>
  The FASIR-NDVI data were used to create fields of FPAR, leaf
  area index, and greenness, which in turn were used to calculate
  monthly snow- free albedo and surface roughness fields, see Sellers
  et al. (1994). The land/sea mask associated with these data sets
  was adopted as the standard for masking the other data placed
  on the CD-rom.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
