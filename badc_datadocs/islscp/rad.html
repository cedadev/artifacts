  <P>Pinker and Laszlo of the University of Maryland processed
  the satellite data analyses held in the ISCCP archive, see Schiffer
  and Rossow (1985), to create five global radiation products.
  The 2.5 deg. x 2.5 deg. ISCCP data were used to generate estimates
  of the surface and top of the atmosphere (TOA) incident and upwelling
  shortwave fluxes. In addition, the surface downwelling PAR flux
  was also calculated. These estimates were generated every 3 hours
  based on GMT observing times, i.e., 0000Z, 0300Z, 0600Z, etc.
  To reduce the noise in their products, Pinker and Laszlo averaged
  the observations for each 3-hour period by month to produce a
  mean diurnal cycle of eight (monthly-averaged) values for each
  month in 1987-1988. NASA LaRC used a similar methodology to generate
  monthly means (not diurnally resolved) of surface incident and
  net shortwave and longwave radiation, and net radiation, see
  Darnell et al. (1992).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
