  <P>The bulk of the near-surface meteorological products on the
  CD were extracted from the ECMWF operational forecast analysis
  archive. <p>
  The data set consists of time-series of meteorological variables
  at 6-hourly intervals (0000Z, 0600Z, 1200Z, 1800Z) and monthly
  6-hourly averages of these and many other diagnostic and prognostic
  variables. <p>
  The meteorological variables that are required to force land-atmosphere
  models with resolved diurnal cycles were extracted from this
  stream: surface pressure, air temperature, dew point, and wind
  speed (magnitude). It was also desired to have incident shortwave
  and longwave radiation fluxes and precipitation rates, preferably
  broken into large-scale and convective components, at the same
  6-hourly temporal resolution. <p>

  However, the ECMWF output did not contain precipitation rates,
  and their radiation flux estimates were thought to be biased
  due to a systematic underestimation of cloud cover by the model
  version used to generate these products. To fill the gap, the
  NASA GSFC team generated hybrid radiation products: the time-series
  of ECMWF estimates of surface shortwave and longwave fluxes were
  used to divide up the NASA LaRC satellite-based monthly radiation
  fluxes into 6-hourly intervals. This resulted in the synthesis
  of 6-hourly incident shortwave and longwave fluxes that add up
  to match the NASA LaRC monthly means. <p>
  A similar procedure was used at NMC by Mitchell to generate 6-hourly
  estimates of precipitation. Six-hourly total and convective precipitation
  fields from the 4DDA-based NMC Reanalysis Project (Kalnay and
  Jenne, 1991) were used to partition the observed monthly GPCP
  precipitation products into 6-hourly time series of estimated
  total and convective precipitation, wherein the total precipitation
  added up to match the GPCP monthly totals. In this procedure,
  a screening was applied, based on the FGGE daily rainfall data,
  following Liston et al. (1993), to better reproduce the observed
  frequency of measurable daily rainfall. All of this effort has
  resulted in a temporally and spatially consistent meteorological
  forcings data set with a 6-hourly timestep. These quantities,
  and some others that were held on the ECMWF record at 6- hourly
  resolution, were processed to provide monthly 6-hourly mean products
  and statistics. Of particular interest are the ECMWF- generated
  estimates of the surface radiation and heat fluxes. <p>

  These fields were generated from a variety of sources (see the
  documentation) and are not recommended as initialization or boundary
  condition fields for current modelers. For example, the ECMWF
  snow-free albedo field is based on the products of Dorman and
  Sellers (1989), which are thought to be less accurate than the
  satellite-data based products. All the ECMWF fields were converted
  from grid cell corner point values to values representative of
  the entire (ECMWF) grid cell; these were then converted to the
  ISLSCP 1&deg; x 1&deg; grid and the land/sea mask was applied.
  In summary, a combination of products from operational meteorological
  agencies (ECMWF and NMC); satellite-data based radiation estimates
  (NASA LaRC); and global surface rain gauge analyses (GPCP) have
  been used to generate time- series of the required near-surface
  model forcings for the period 1987-1988 at a 6-hourly time resolution.
  These are supported by a range of ancillary time- averaged quantities
  that may be useful for forcing models that run on a monthly timestep.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
