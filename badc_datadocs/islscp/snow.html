  <P>NOAA NESDIS provides a weekly analysis of Northern Hemisphere
  snow cover from optical satellite data; the analyses are done
  by hand. Robinson (pers. comm.) of Rutgers University provided
  these data after regridding them to 1&deg; x 1&deg; The U.S.
  Air Force assembles a monthly snow depth map based on a variety
  of sources including satellite data and in situ measurements
  carried out at reporting airfields. The NOAA National Meteorological
  Center (NMC) provided analyses of sea ice cover and sea surface
  temperature at monthly time resolution at the required 1&deg;
  x 1&deg; resolution. The land/sea mask was then applied at GSFC.
  Last, a fine resolution map of the land-ocean boundary was provided
  by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) based
  on data collated by the U.S. Navy. Global monthly fields of sea
  surface temperature (SST) and sea ice concentration were also
  included in the data set in response to requests from GCM modelers
  who wished to have a complete set of surface boundary conditions
  on the CD.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
