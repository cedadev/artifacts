  <P>The Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) reanalyzed
  their archive of surface rain gauge data to produce a 1&deg;
  x 1&deg;. monthly precipitation product for 1987-1988. The standard
  land/sea mask was applied by the publication group at NASA GSFC.
  The Global Runoff Data Center (GRDC) contributed monthly river
  runoff rate data for 14 basins together with information on the
  location of the gauges and the catchment area upstream of the
  gauge. The percentage of each 1&deg; x 1&deg; grid area covered
  by lakes, rivers, and marshes was obtained from data published
  by Cogley (1991). The Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO)
  archive on soil properties has been extensively scrutinized by
  researchers at the University of Arizona (Sorooshian, Amer),
  NASA GSFC (Koster) and at NASA GISS (Zobler). These analyses
  were combined to create consistent global fields of soil texture,
  depth, and slope.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
