  <P>The main focus of the NDACC project is to make global measurements
  in the altitude region from the tropopause to about 50km. The
  following measurements have been identified as being of the highest
  priority to the NDACC:</P>
  <UL>
    <LI>Column ozone
    <LI>Vertical profile of ozone (0-70km)
    <LI>Temperature (0-70km)
    <LI>Vertical profile of ClO
    <LI>Vertical profile of H2O
    <LI>Vertical distribution of aerosols
    <LI>Vertical profile or column of NO2
    <LI>Stratospheric column of HCL
    <LI>Vertical profiles of long-lived tracers: CH4 and N2O
    <LI>Other species (HNO3, ClONO2 and OH)
  </UL>
  <P>These priorities are based on the assumption that existing
  and planned satellite measurements activities will continue,
  as will the ground-level monitoring of ozone and long-lived gases
  by existing networks.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

  <H4>2.1.1 Primary Stations</H4>

  <P>The NDACC has <A HREF="/data/ndsc/stations/index.html">5
  Primary Stations</A> which make up the core of its activities.
  All except the New Zealand station are composites i.e. they are
  composed of more than one measurements site.</P>

  <H4>2.1.2 Complementary Stations</H4>

  <P>There are also <A HREF="/data/ndsc/stations/index.html#complementary">over
  20 Complementary Stations</A> which make measurements under the
  complementary measurements protocol of the NDACC. These measurements
  are selected to provide specific benefit to the NDACC primary
  activities, for example through their geographic location, measurement
  technique or addition scientific value.</P>

  <H4>2.1.3 Global view</H4>

  A map provided by NDACC also displays the distribution of the
  <a href="stations/ndsc_map.html">NDACC sites</a> around the world.

  <H3>2.2 <A NAME="instruments"></A>Instruments</H3>

  <P>Instruments were selected on the basis of being remote sensors,
  capable of continuous, long-term field operation, potentially
  in remote locations. Depending on specific site characteristics
  such as geography, meteorology and complementary existing programs,
  each of the primary NDACC stations are equipped with most or all
  of the set of instruments listed below, in order to make the
  following measurements: <BR>

  For nearly all of the instruments, it is desirable to locate
  the monitoring station at high elevation (&gt;2000 meters) in
  order to minimize the tropospheric water and aerosol columns.
  The goal of understanding the cause of changes, rather than merely
  detecting them, requires that the instruments be co-located to
  an extent consistent with the temporal and spatial requirements
  of the measurements and the realities of site availability. Where
  it is not feasible to co-locate all the instruments on the same
  site, a composite station may be formed with individual instruments
  or groups of instruments at different sites.</P>
  <H3>2.3 <A NAME="protocols"></A>Data Protocols</H3>
  <P>The network's data lie at the heart of its contribution to
  understanding stratospheric change. The nature of long-term trends
  measurement requires these data to be fully verified before they
  can be used for comparison with models or to deduce trends. It
  is the spirit and purpose of the NDACC to foster the broadest
  possible collaboration among all interested scientists as quickly
  as possible. However, as with any good research, the Principal
  Investigators (PIs) bear the ultimate responsibility for data
  quality. In order to achieve a verifiable data set, sufficient
  time is needed to collect, reduce, test, analyse and intercompare
  the anticipated streams of continuous preliminary data from each
  of as many as five sites. <BR>
  The NDACC data protocol is aimed at achieving the dual goals of
  excellent data quality and ready data access. The main features
  are:</P>
  <UL>
    <LI>Any NDACC PI may establish the scientific collaborations necessary
    for the optimum testing and verification of their own measurements.
    <LI>All PIs shall place their preliminary analyses of measurements
    in the NDACC archive as rapidly as possible and no later than
    one year after measurement.
    <LI>Given the nature of small trends detection, it is recognised
    that multiple seasonal analyses may be required. It is expected
    that such a procedure will yield the verifiable product referred
    to as &quot;NDACC data&quot; within a two-year period after acquisition.
    <LI>After the above verification, NDACC data will be available
    to anyone through a centralised scientific archiving and distribution
    facility and will be accessible by electronic transfer.
  </UL>
The <a href="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/ndsc/doc/protocol/">NDACC protocols</a>
are available from the BADC archive.
