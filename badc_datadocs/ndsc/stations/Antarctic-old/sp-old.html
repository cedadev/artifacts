<P><B>Ozone Lidar</B></P>

<P>T. J. McGee and M. Gross (GSFC) - Mobile intercomparator that
has participated in ozone intercomparisons at Table Mountain Facility
(34.4&deg;N, 117.7&deg;W); Observatoire Haute Provence (43.94&deg;N,
5.71&deg;E); Lauder (45.05&deg;S, 169.68&deg;E); and Mauna Loa
(19.54&deg;N, 155.58&deg;W). Will return briefly to TMF in February
1997 and OHP in early summer 1997 before a summer 1997/summer
1998 intercomparison at Ny &Aring;lesund (78.92&deg;N, 11.93&deg;E).
Also retrieves temperature and aerosols.</P>

<P><B>Aerosol Lidar</B></P>

<P>O. Schrems (AWI) - Mobile aerosol Raman lidar, participated
in a ship-based expedition (ALBATROSS campaign) from 70&deg;N
to 40&deg;S during October to November 1996. Also participated
in the STRAIT intercomparison campaign at TMF in February/March
1997 prior to returning to Ny &Aring;lesund (78.92&deg;N, 11.93&deg;E)
for further intercomparisons.</P>

<P><B>Microwave H2O</B></P>

<P>C. Croskey (Penn State) - Mobile intercomparator under development.
Will undergo field testing and intercomparison with NRL instrument
at Table Mountain Facility (34.4&deg;N, 117.7&deg;W). Deployment
decisions to be made pending completion of development, testing,
and validation.</P>

<P>P. Woods and W. Bell (NPL) - Mobile Bruker instrument used
primarily for intercomparisons and campaigns. Has operated at
Alpine Station (Jungfraujoch; 46.8&deg;N, 8.0&deg;E).</P>

<P><B>FTIR</B></P>

<P>D. Murcray and F. Murcray (U. Denver) - Mobile intercomparator
developed by modification of existing field instrument; possible
deployment at interim Antarctic site.</P>
