Longitude:  169.68</PRE>

<P><HR ALIGN=LEFT><B>Ozone Lidar</B></P>

<P>D. P. J. Swart (RIVM) - Installed in October 1994. Participated
in OPAL intercomparison with GSFC mobile lidar, LaRC microwave
ozone radiometer, and ozonesondes in 1995. Retrieving between
8 and 50 km year-round. Plans to extend retrievals to temperature
and aerosols.</P>

<P><B>Aerosol Lidar</B></P>

<P>O. Uchino (MRI) and W. A. Matthews (NIWA) - Mobile Nd:YAG system
operated extensively at Tsukuba (36.05&deg;N, 140.13&deg;E) for
retrievals between 6 and 35 km; deployed at Lauder in November
1992.</P>

<P><B>T and Aerosol Lidar</B></P>

<P>L. Stefanutti and M. Morandi (IROE), J. P. Wolf (U. Lyon),
and B. Liley (NIWA) - System used initially at Dumont d'Urville
(66.67&deg;S, 140.01&deg;E) and refurbished for the NDSC; deployed
at Lauder in December 1992 for aerosol profiles from 5 to 35 km
and temperature from 5 to 70 km.</P>

<P><B>UV/Vis. Spectr.</B></P>

<P>P. V. Johnston and W. A. Matthews (NIWA) - Intercompared with
NOAA and SAOZ systems in 1992. Database extends back to 1980.</P>

<P><B>Microwave Ozone</B></P>

<P>A. Parrish (Millitech & U. MA), J. J. Tsou (GATS Inc.), and
B. J. Connor (NIWA) - Retrieving profiles from 20 to 64 km since
November 1992 to April 1993 continuing from April 1995. Instrument
is identical to Mauna Loa system and participated in intercomparisons
at Table Mountain Facility (34.4&deg;N, 117.7&deg;W) in July 1989,
Observatoire Haute Provence (43.94&deg;N, 5.71&deg;E) in July
1992, and Lauder in April 1995. This instrument also operated
at Table Mountain Facility from July to November 1989 and from
May 1990 to June 1992.</P>

<P><B>Microwave H2O</B></P>

<P>R. Bevilacqua, P. R. Schwartz, and G. Nedoluha (NRL) - NRL
WVMS1 deployed from November 1992 to April 1993 and January 1994
to present following tests and intercomparisons at Table Mountain
Facility (34.4&deg;N, 117.7&deg;W); presently retrieving from
40 to 80 km.</P>

<P><B>FTIR</B></P>

<P>N. B. Jones and W. A. Matthews (NIWA) - Bruker 120-M with 0.0035-cm-1
resolution; operating since August 1990.</P>

<P><B>Ozonesondes</B></P>

<P>W. A. Matthews and G. Bodeker (NIWA) - Weekly ECC sondes year-round
since August 1985.</P>

<P><B>Aerosolsondes</B></P>

<P>T. Deshler (U. WY) - Backscatter measurements of aerosol profiles
(0 to 34 km) monthly since February 1992.</P>

<P><B>Spectral UV</B></P>

<P>R. L. McKenzie and P. V. Johnston (NIWA) - Spectral distribution
(290 to 450 nm at 1-nm resolution) measurements of UV radiation
since December 1989. A variety of filter radiometers have also
been used since January 1991.</P>
