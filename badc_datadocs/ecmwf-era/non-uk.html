<H1>Non-UK users of ECMWF data <BR CLEAR="ALL"></H1>

<P><EM>A response to queries from researchers outside the UK interested
in using ECMWF data.</EM> <HR ALIGN=LEFT>This page has been produced
in response to a number of queries from scientists outside the
UK who wish to obtain ECMWF data from the BADC. Unfortunately,
the BADC's agreement with the ECMWF expressly forbids us from
supplying ECMWF data to non-UK users. 

<P>To clarify the situations, there are 3 different ways for european
scientists to get ECMWF data: 
<P>
<OL>
  <LI>Through their own National Meteorological Service.
  <LI>Applying for time on the ECMWF computers to extract it themselves.
  <LI>Buying it from ECMWF.
</OL>

<P>The BADC only holds ECMWF data, because the UK Met Office
has delegated its responsibility for the first method to the BADC,
so we are only allowed to distribute to users <EM>who would otherwise
get their data from the UK Met Office</EM>.
