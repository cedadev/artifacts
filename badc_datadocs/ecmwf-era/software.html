<HR ALIGN=LEFT>

<H2>Introduction</H2>
This page details a number of software options for decoding GRIB (GRIdded Binary) data that are available from the BADC:

<UL>
  <LI><a href="#gribex">ECMWF GRIBEX Fortran code software</a>
  <LI><a href="#local">Local software for GRIB decoding</a>
  <LI><a href="#other">Other software for decoding, converting and subsetting GRIB files</a>
</UL>

<H2><a name="gribex">ECMWF GRIBEX Fortran code software (now replaced by GRIB_API)</a></H2>
The ECMWF provides Fortran routines and example programs to decode GRIB data. This software is 
now publicly and freely available from the 
<A HREF="https://software.ecmwf.int/wiki/display/GRIB/Home">ECMWF software pages</A>. Documentation 
is also provided for users.

 
<H2><a name="local">Local software for GRIB decoding</a></H2>
<P>The BADC have adapted the GRIBEX sample routines to provide some quick-look
facilities for GRIB files.  These routines are available on <I>login.badc.rl.ac.uk</I>, the BADC server.
The routines can be used to list the
record header information, giving information on the parameters, levels, dates
within the file, and/or decode and list the data itself in ASCII format. 

Files stored on the BADC contain many GRIB records and decoding them using any
of the following routines often results in large amounts of output.  It is a
good idea to <I>pipe</I> the output into the <I>more</I> command or redirect the output to a different
file.  The utilities are provided mainly for a quick-look facility.  The decoded
data output from the utilities takes up more disk space than the GRIB files and
it is suggested that to use the GRIB data it is more efficient to download the
GRIB files to your local machine rather than decoded text versions.

<h3>Decoding the record headers</h3>
The record headers contain information on the parameters, levels, dates, data
grid etc. within the file.  A list of the headers can be obtained using the
program <kbd>grib2brief</kbd>.
<pre>
grib2brief file | more
</pre>

To get very brief output pipe the output of <kbd>grib2brief</kbd> through
<kbd>grep</kbd>. 

<pre>
grib2brief file | grep "Section 0" | wc -l
</pre>
gives the number of GRIB records in the file.

<pre>
grib2brief file | grep "Parameter" | sort | uniq
</pre>
lists the parameters present in the file.

<h3>Decoding the data</h3>
The BADC provide two utilities that can be used to decode the data as well as
the record header information.  The first, <kbd>grib2fulltxt</kbd>, gives full
record header information as well as the data.  The second, <kbd>grib2txt</kbd>
gives an abbreviated form of the record headers as well as the data.  The
abbreviated header is a simple column of data.  The rows in the column are:
parameter, leveltype, level, year, month, day, hour, minute.

<pre>
grib2fulltxt file
</pre>

<pre>
grib2txt file
</pre>

<h3>GRIB record filters</h3>
A couple of utilities are provided to help reduce the size of GRIB files that
are downloaded from the BADC.  These utilities extract GRIB records, either by
level or parameter, from a GRIB file.  To
filter a particular level out of a GRIB file use <kbd>griblevel</kbd>.  To
filter a particular parameter out of a GRIB file use <kbd>gribparameter</kbd>.

<pre>
griblevel -l level file_in > file_out
</pre>

to extract level <kbd>level</kbd> or
<pre>
gribparameter -p parameter file_in > file_out
</pre>

to extract parameter <kbd>parameter</kbd>.  At present <kbd>griblevel</kbd> and
<kbd>gribparameter</kbd> will only extract one level or parameter at a time.
 

<h2><kbd>gribdecode</kbd></h2>
In the current implementation all of the above GRIB utilities sit on top of a
single program <kbd>gribdecode</kbd>.  To get more information use
<pre>
gribdecode -h
</pre>


<h2><a name="other">Other software for decoding, converting and subsetting GRIB files</a></h2>
The BADC provides an X windows utility called <a href="/help/software/xconv">XCONV</a> which allows the user to interactively manipulate GRIB data. 
The package includes format conversion, interpolation, sub-setting and plotting options. 
XCONV is presented via a user-friendly Graphical User Interface.

<P>The BADC also provides a the <a href="/help/software/xconv">CONVSH</A> 
utility which is a command-line equivalent of XCONV. 
Scripts can be written for CONVSH to batch process data files. Both packages can are available via 
<a href="/help/software/xconv/index.html#download">download</a> for a number 
of different platforms. The BADC has developed the 
<a href="/help/software/xconv/subset.html">subset.tcl</a> command line utility 
to allow subsetting, batch processing and conversion of GRIB files. 
 
<P>If you have any problems with the GRIB decoding utilities please contact 
<a href="/help/contact.html">BADC Support</a>.
