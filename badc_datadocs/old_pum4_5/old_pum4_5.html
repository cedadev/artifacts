		<h2><img src="/graphics/blue/info.gif" border="0" align="BOTTOM">Introduction</h2>
This dataset contains Portable Unified Model Software (PUM) from the UK Met Office. This allows the Unified Model to be run on a user's own system. This version, 4.5, has now been superseded by <A HREF="/data/pum5_5">version 5.5</A>. It also contains community contributions associated with the PUM. 
		<p>These pages describe the Portable Unified Model (PUM) software from the Met Office. The Unified Model is the name given to the suite of atmospheric and oceanic numerical modelling software developed and used at the Met Office. The model supports global and regional domains and a wide range of temporal and spatial scales that allow it to be used for both numerical weather prediction and climate modelling, as well as a variety of related research activities. This software allows the Unified Model to be run on a user's own system.</p>
<p><b>Please note that this is the MODEL SOFTWARE ONLY, not the UM model output, which is at http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/um/</b></p>

		<h2><img src="/graphics/blue/key.gif" border="0" align="BOTTOM"> Restricted data</h2>
		<p>Access to Met. Office PUM&nbsp;source code at the BADC is restricted. 
The <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dataset_registration/dataset_info.cgi.pl?datasetid=ukmo_code">application for access to the Met Office Portable Unified Model Software</a>
 includes the Met Office Agreement to be signed and returned to BADC.You will then be given access to these datasets via a Web account. Details of your account will be sent by e-mail.</p>
		<h2><img src="/graphics/blue/data.gif" border="0" align="BOTTOM">Access to data</h2>
		<p>The Met. Office Operational PUM&nbsp;source code is stored in two directories corresponding to the two CD's distributed by the Met Office. The dataset directory is at <a href="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/ukmo-pum">/badc/ukmo-pum/</a> .</p>
		<h2><img src="/graphics/blue/book.gif" border="0" align="BOTTOM">Documentation</h2>
		<p>Detailed documentation about the PUM&nbsp;is provided with the source code and is available in both HTML and postscript formats.</p>
                <p>The PUM is available as an RPM (<a href="./rpms.html">install guide and notes</a>)
