README.DOC  (1994-01-12 - pgh)

1.  Introduction

    This CD-ROM contains the data pertaining to the Stratospheric 
    Photochemistry, Aerosols and Dynamics Expedition (SPADE) which was 
    based at Ames Research Center in California during portions of 1992
    and 1993.  Most of the data are in essentially final form, however
    additional calibration work is being done for some of the instruments.
    None of the instrument data is expected to change significantly from
    the values reported here.  A second edition incorporating updates
    and/or changes to the data is anticipated in late 1994 or early 1995.
 
    The data consist of measurements collected onboard the NASA ER-2
    aircraft, and selected radiosonde soundings from stations in the 
    region of the experiment.  Flights were conducted during October 
    and November of 1992, April and May of 1993, and October of 1993.
 
    Theory team products come in two forms -- as quantities evaluated 
    along flight tracks and as global or hemispheric fields.
    Meteorological quantities, such as temperature, geopotential, and 
    potential vorticity are available in both forms.  They are based
    on analyses from both the U.S. National Meteorological Center and
    from the Assimilation Model of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.
    Other quantities, available along flight tracks only, include visible
    reflectivity, cloud height, UV reflectivity, and total ozone.  The 
    first two are derived from GOES imagery, the last two from the Meteor
    TOMS sensor.  Finally, calculations of mixing ratios of selected 
    chemical species using a photochemical steady state model are 
    available along the flight track.

    All files within this release are standard ASCII files with variable 
    length records terminated by a carriage return/line feed pair (<CR><LF>,
    ASCII decimal values 13 and 10).  Therefore, MS-DOS users should be able 
    to read them as they are, but UNIX and Mac users will have to strip off 
    either the <CR> or the <LF> from each line to convert them to standard 
    UNIX or Mac files.  Commercially available software, such as dos2unix 
    and Apple File Exchange, exists to convert MS-DOS files to both UNIX 
    and Mac files.  VMS users can define the files to have STREAM record 
    formats.
 
    The file naming convention uses a two-character prefix to identify the 
    measurement, followed by a six digit number (yymmdd) giving the year, 
    month, and day (UT) of the flight, balloon launch, or model result.  
    To identify the measurement platform, a three character extension of 
    EA1, Bhh, or Ghh is used to denote the data is from the ER-2, balloon,
    or grid point model output (hh denotes the UT hour of balloon launch or 
    model result).


2.  Directories

    2.1  The DOCUMENT directory contains several files documenting the 
         contents of this edition.

         Files:

         2.1.1  CONTACT.DOC contains an updated list of names, addresses,
                and phone numbers of the principal investigators responsible
                for generating the datasets in this release.

         2.1.2  ER2TABLE.DOC contains a record of the available ER-2 datasets
                in tabular format.

         2.1.3  FORSPEC1.PS and FORSPEC2.PS are PostScript files of the
                document entitled "Format Specification for Data Exchange"
                which defines the standard file formats in which all data are
                recorded.  These two PostScript files can be printed on any 
                printer that understands PostScript.  FORSPEC1.PS contains the
                title page and table of contents; FORSPEC2.PS contains the
                bulk of the document.

         2.1.4  UV_VIS.DOC contains a detailed description of the UV-Vis
                experiment, also known as the Composition and 
                Photodissociative Flux Measurement (CPFM).  Note that the
                file name contains an underscore, not a hyphen, to conform
                to the ISO 9660 file naming standards.

    2.2  The DATA directory has three subdirectories for the ER-2, model
         results, and radiosonde soundings data files.

         Subdirectories:

         2.2.1  ER2 contains the available data collected onboard the ER-2
                aircraft.  It also contains several derived quantities.
                These include (1) "string files" (values along the flight
                track) and "curtain files" (values in a vertical curtain
                along the flight track) of potential vorticity, temperature,
                geopotential, and horizontal wind (derived from analyses
                of U.S. National Meteorological Center data and the 
                Assimilation Model of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center);
                (2) "string files" of underlying visible and UV 
                reflectivity, underlying cloud height, and total ozone;
                and (3) "string files" of selected species mixing ratios
                from a photochemical steady state model.  Each file 
                contains data for one flight which begins on the UT date
                indicated by the file name.

         2.2.2  MODEL contains 12 Z hemispheric analyses of potential 
                vorticity, temperature, horizontal winds, and geopotential.

         2.2.3  RAOB contains selected radiosonde soundings near the aircraft 
                flight tracks.  Each file contains one or more soundings 
                for a particular time period.
