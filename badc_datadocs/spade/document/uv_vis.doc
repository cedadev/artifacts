           Description of the UV-VIS Experiment   23/12/93
           ====================================

The Composition and Photodissociative Flux Measurement (CPFM) is made
using a small spectrometer mounted in a wing pod on the right-hand wing 
of the ER-2.  The instrument operates autonomously according to a 
measurement sequence coded into it before flight.  Data are recorded 
using a data assimilation algorithm which runs on a '386, single-board 
computer mounted on the door of the E-bay.  Data are removed from the
computer after each flight and converted from the packed-binary format
stored on-board into a number of useful data formats.

UV-VIS data are collected using a 1024-element photodiode array
spectrophotometer.  Using order separating filters, measurements
are made in the near UV (300 - 387 nm) and in the visible (375 -
775 nm).  The instrument is programmed to make measurements of the
radiation field in several different ways.  These include
measurements of the flux on a horizontal surface, measurements of
the limb brightness at various elevation angles, and observations
of the apparent surface brightness below the aircraft track. 
Horizontal flux measurements, which are done using a teflon
diffuser, are unpolarized.  The limb measurements include two
polarization components, horizontal and vertical.  The nadir
measurement is of the polarization component along the aircraft
track only.  It is to be assumed that the other component is equal
in magnitude to the one measured.  Therefore the total nadir
brightness value is two times the reported one.

The detector outputs, which are measured with an A/D converter, are 
converted to absolute intensity or brightness units using
calibration data from a NIST-traceable quartz-halogen lamp.  In the
case of the diffuser port, the lamp directly illuminates the
entrance surface; in the case of the direct viewing directions a
certified, reflective diffuser is illuminated by the lamp to
produce a surface of calculable surface brightness.  The
observation data are corrected for the instrument responsivity
using calibrations made using the lamp and diffuser to produce
results in absolute intensity and brightness units.

Data from each viewing direction, for both polarizations, the UV
and visible measurement bands, and from the internal krypton and
neon lamps, are all separately processed.  All the atmospheric data
are scaled using the known responsivity of the instrument.  The
data from the different wavebands are then interpolated and
combined to give a continuous spectrum from 300 nm to about 775 nm. 
For convenience, the data are reported from 300 to 800 in steps of
0.5 nm (1000 points).  The spectrum will always start at 300 nm and
will run to some highest wavelength around 775 nm.  The extra
spectral values, long of the cut-off value, are set to zero.  The
visible data are smoothed before interpolation by a 3 pixel (approx
1.2 nm) FWHM running triangular filter, and the UV by a 5 step
(about 1.0 nm) FWHM filter.  This filtering removes some of the
differences in resolution between the two wavebands which exists
because the UV data are taken in the second order of the
diffraction grating.  The match is not exact because the resolution
of the instrument is partly controlled by the imaging properties of
the grating.  The small difference in resolution between the two
orders can be seen in the final spectra.  The last two reported
values in the spectrum are not filtered.

Once the spectra are combined, several other derived quantities are 
calculated.  These include the fluxes within several wavebands, the
column amount of ozone and the photodissociation rate for various
reactions determined from the measured radiation levels.  The
values calculated for the horizontal diffusing surface have the
clearest physical interpretation.  The apparent surface brightness
derived for the other viewing directions must be scaled by
estimates of the solid angles for which the measured brightnesses are
appropriate in order to produce units of effective power per unit
wavelength.

         Data Description for two data product types
         ===========================================

Two types of data files have been prepared from the CPFM
observations for the SPADE flights.  These are complete spectra as
observed, but scaled to true  radiation units, and a number of
derived products which are described below.

1.  File type - US{date}.ea1

     Spectral Irradiance values every 0.5 nm.

2.  File Type - UV{date}.ea1

     Derived quantities such as J-values and waveband integrals.


The spectra (File Type 1) are presented as an ASCII file in Ames format
number 2010 as a sequence of 1000 spectral flux values reported every
half nm.  Only the downward (diffuser) flux values are reported.  The
same housekeeping records which are associated with each block of
derived data (File Type 2), Ames format 1010, are included at the start
of each spectrum.  The spectra have not been corrected for the cosine
dependence of the diffuser, so that the values represent a measurement
of the horizontal flux, not the direct beam irradiance.  The
information given below should serve as a guide to making a correction
to the measured values to estimate the direct beam spectral fluxes. 
The angle between the diffuser normal in flight and the direction of
the vector from the aircraft to the sun has been calculated and is
included in the housekeeping record.

     The reduced data are presented in records which contain
measurements of 4 different radiation fields.  Each column in the
table is labelled at the top of the table. The time in seconds from
the beginning of the day of aircraft launch is included in column
1.  The fourth entry is time in hhmmss where hh is hours, mm is
minutes and ss is seconds GMT (CUT).  The complete data record for
one instrument observation cycle is comprised of 4 lines.  They
are, in order:

Records in rotation of the following quantities:

     0.  Horizontal flux on upper diffuser surface
         [microwatts per square centimetre per nanometre]
     1.  Vertical polarization component of the Limb brightness at 
         one of ten elevation angles.
         [microwatts per square centimetre per steradian per      
         nanometre]
     2.  Horizontal polarization component of the Limb brightness 
         at one of ten elevation angles.
         [microwatts per square centimetre per steradian per      
         nanometre]
     3.  Nadir surface brightness in the polarization direction

           on the surface were due to the direct solar beam,      
           dividing by the cosine of this angle would

  SAA    - solar azimuth angle in MET coordinates relative to the 
           limb viewing direction (out the starboard wing).  0 to

           360 is to the right.
  Roll   - aircraft roll angle.  Positive roll is with the right  
           wing down.
  cO3    - column ozone in m-atm-cm (i.e.: Dobson units).  Has a

           75 degrees.

           [microwatts per cm squared per nm for horizontal diffuser
           and microwatts per cm squared per nm per steradian for the
           other surfaces].
  350 -    average intensity in a waveband from 325 to 350
           [microwatts per cm squared per nm for horizontal diffuser

In order to use the reported data to determine total J-values or
specific power levels for a particular volume, the contribution of
the fields from various directions must be combined.  There are 4
in total: the solar direct beam, the limb contribution (2
polarization components), and the upward flux.

The solar direct beam component.

If the solar direct beam component were the only intensity acting
on the horizontal diffuser, the reported flux could be interpreted
in a very simple  way.  If RZA is the relative solar zenith angle,
that is the angle between the detector (diffuser) surface normal
and the sun direction vector, then the  apparent normal flux, Fn
(microwatts per square centimetre per nanometre), is related to the
direct beam intensity, Fd by the relation Fn = Fd * cos(RZA).  In
practice there are two other components due to the intensities Ih
and Is where Ih is the horizon brightness, and Is is the sky
brightness.  The sky includes approximately 2 PI steradians.  At 20
km altitude the limb occupies about 4.5 degrees of zenith angle,
contributing about 4.5 / 180 * PI radians times 2 PI.  The sensor is
rolled outboard from the vertical by 3.4 degrees (+3.4 degrees in the
MET coordinate system) so the full horizon is not observed.  (The MET 
coordinate system has +x east, +y north and +y up). If the Earth as seen
near the horizon is assumed to be the same brightness as the limb, then
the amount of light seen by the diffuser will increase with roll angle

     Fh = ( 3.4 + roll ) / 180 * 2 * PI^2        for roll > -3.4

            and   Fh = 0.0                       for roll < -3.4

        PI is 3.141592...

The same equation holds for the flux of vertically polarized light,
Fv.

        Clearly, this formulation does not include the fact that
the atmospheric brightness does increase with decreasing altitude.

 Therefore the complete equation using

         Fs = Is * 2 * PI (as above) is:


         Im = Id * cos( RZA ) + Is * 2 * PI + Fh 

Therefore the solar direct beam intensity can only be estimated
given some knowledge of the sky and horizon components.  The
horizon component will, in  general, depend on the azimuth angle of
the sun relative to the aircraft and will also be a function of the
absolute solar zenith angle (SZA).  If some assumption is made of
what the horizon component is, using the above equation for Fh, and
if the sun is reasonably high in the sky (say SZA < 70 degrees)
then the direct beam intensity can be determined from

                   Fd = (Fm - Fh) / cos( RZA )

where it has been assumed that the sky component Fs is negligible. 
In order to  make the best use of the measurements, it is probably
necessary to have a model  estimate of the ratio of the direct beam
to the sky, and to use measured values  for the horizon component.

     If the horizon component were due to Rayleigh scattering only,
the two  polarization  components would vary with relative solar
azimuth angle as the  Rayleigh phase function.  That is:

               Iv = Io
               Ih = Io * cos^2( SAA )

      where the total intensity is Ih + Iv
            and SAA is the relative solar azimuth angle.

      With large amounts of aerosol in the upper atmosphere the
true brightness  levels can be twice as large at large azimuth
angles and even higher near the  solar direction.

      The contribution of light diffusely reflected from the
aircraft has not been included.  This is because it is not
significant.  The aircraft appears to subtend a maximum angle of
about 5 degrees above the position of the CPFM diffuser surface. 
Since the diffuser is rolled outboard by 3.4 degrees this means
that the aircraft is only in view for about 2 degrees.  Since the
contribution is cosine weighted at the diffuser, this will make a
very small additional flux compared to the error in estimating the
horizon contribution.  The aircraft is about 1 radian long (as seen
by the diffuser) and about 0.03 radians high giving a total solid
angle of about 0.03 compared with 0.3 radians for the horizon ( 3.4
/ 180 * 2 * PI^2 ).

      When the sun is high in the sky the total flux which a
molecule sees can be approximated by summing the various
components:

             Ft = Fd + 2 * Fn + Fh + Fv

      The nadir flux, Fn is doubled because only one polarization
is measured  and it is assumed that the upwelling radiation is
unpolarized.

      In order to estimate the nadir flux (Fn) properly, it must be
appreciated that the rapid changes in the apparent surface
brightness beneath the aircraft are not directly seen by an air
parcel since the area immediately under the aircraft is only a
small part of the solid angle subtended by the surface under the
flight path.  An average of the apparent surface brightness over a
distance scale representative of the averaging area under the
aircraft should be used.  A solid angle if about PI/2 (or 1/4 of
the full solid angle under the aircraft) is probably
representative.  At an altitude of 20 km, taking 90 degrees as
about 1.5 radians, the surface area seen is 1.5 * 400 square km. 
This gives a linear dimension of 25 km.  With a ground speed of 800
km/hr, 60/16 = 4 minutes of data should be averaged to give a
reasonable estimate half of the surface contribution.  In simple
terms, several nadir measurements should be averaged.

      When the sun is high in the sky, the sky and horizon fluxes
can be neglected giving

                       Ft = Fd * cos( SZA )

    clearly the direct beam flux is Fd = Ft / cos( SZA )

One additional instrumental effect is important.  The diffuser
surface does not exactly follow the cosine relation above. 
Therefore the direct beam component which is seen at the diffuser
is actually

             Ft = Fd * cos( SZA ) * correction(wavelength, angle)

      In the original implementation, the diffuser used on the CPFM
was too thin,  and a direct transmission component of the radiation
is evident at long wavelengths.  The table below shows the measured
performance of the diffuser.  For ASHOE/MAESA the diffuser will be
doubled up to eliminate the wavelength dependence. However, the
diffuser will remain non-ideal and will therefore still require a
cosine correction to be applied.  Because of the wavelength
dependence of the diffuser cosine error, the correction to be
applied to each flux integral or J-value will be somewhat dependent
on the wavelengths included and the spectral quality of the light
measured.  The spectra included in the spectral data file can be
used to estimate the error in using a typical wavelength to choose
the effective cosine correction for the flux at a particular zenith
angle.

=============================================================================

      In using the limb data, it should be noted that the angle of
view of the limb-viewing port relative to the sun is given by the
angle RAA in the data tables.  In addition the precise elevation
angle which the beam makes with respect to the horizon is modified
by the mechanical reference position of the pointing mirror inside
the instrument, the angle at which the instrument is installed in
the aircraft wing, and the roll angle of the plane in flight.  In
an equation:

              EL( ST ) = RA + REF + ST * IN + roll

         RA   - relative angle in aircraft e.g.: 3.4 degrees      
         REF  - reference angle relative to diffuser direction; 82.5 degrees
         ST   - step number recorded in data block
         IN   - step size of scanner = 1.5 degrees
         Roll - aircraft roll angle in data table

      A first approximation for correcting the horizontal diffuser
values is to assume that the horizon brightness does not change
with time after about 75 degrees SZA and that the mean of a number
of observations at various azimuth angles is representative of the
horizon.  A somewhat better estimate can be made by determining an
approximate variation of the brightness with azimuth angle.  This
estimate can then be used in the above equations to calculate the
contributions to the flux at altitude appropriate for a particular
application. Ultimately the best approach will to be to use a model
which has been verified in detail using flight data for the
determination of the appropriate flux value.

SPADE Flights 1992, 1993
------------------------

      The CPFM experiment was flown on most of the fall, 1992, and spring
1993 SPADE flights.  Because the instrument was very much still in a 
developmental phase, not all of the flights lead to useful data.  The 
following table summarizes the dates on which the instrument might have 
flown, on which it actually flew, those fligths which have been analyzed 
and those for which data have been included in this release.

      There are a number of reasons for not contributing fully
processed data at this time.  These include:

  1) the instrument did not fly on a flight because it was not
     scheduled to, or because it was not operating
  2) [for the fall] the gain mode needed to have complete 1024-element
     spectra on scale was not yet available, and so the spectra were 
     taken in 256-pixel sub-spectra which have not yet been converted
     to a form suitable for processing using the data reduction software
  3) the gains on either the UV or visible spectral order were set 
     incorrectly
  4) the instrument failed in flight
  5) the on-board navigation data stream became unavailable during 
     flight (further work to assimilate the post-flight data is
     required; this applies mainly to the attitude information).
  6) a problem with the instrument, but it was flown anyway
  7) data recorder failure

General comments on the SPADE series data.
------------------------------------------

    Ozone data.

    During the SPADE series, there was no independently traceable ozone 
    calibration for the CPFM instrument.  Neither had tests been done to 
    see how well the reduction algorithm worked at determining ozone 
    levels at the surface.  Because there is no solar pointing on the 
    aircraft, the total ozone column is determined by making a 
    ratiometric measurement in the UV portion of the spectrum as 
    observed by the horizontal diffuser.  This measurment will be very 
    good at altitude where the direct solar intensity completely dominates 
    other sources of light (such as the scattered sky light) but near 
    the surface where the pressure is higher and especially when clouds 
    are present, the results may be considerably in error.  As result, 
    the calibration (extraterrestrial constant) for the ozone 
    measurement was estimated by comparing results to TOMS 
    measurements and making a reasonable choice of calibration constants.  
    The best indication that the choice is close is the small solar angle 
    dependence of the data on the flight of May 12th.  The same constant
    is used for alll flights.


Flight Specific Comments
------------------------

93/05/11

      This flight produced apparently good UV data for all fields except 
the horizontal flux.  Only UV data are available because the reference 
sensor for initializing the filter wheel motor failed.  As a temporary 
remedy, the filter was permanently set, a few minutes before 'hands
off' at the UV measuring position, and flew that way for the whole
flight.  The failure was corrected before the next flight.  However, it 
appears that the prism drive motor did not function completely 
correctly since the horizontal flux measurements are of a very much 
lower intensity than those made on other days under comparable 
conditions.  The ozone values were still computed, but the results have 
higher-than-usual noise level becasue of the low signal level.


FTP at the Atmospheric Environment Service
------------------------------------------

      Sometime in January, 1994 the AES will make an FTP server
available to the community.  It will on a computer at the downsview 
facility and will have a copy of the data included here and available on 
CLOUD1.  In addition, the full spectral data for ALL radiation fields, not 
just the horizontal flux, will be available.  Cosine corrected data will 
also be provided including an estimate of the total photochemically 
active fluxes.  These last two products should be ready in a couple of 
months.

      The file server is at address 142.97.22.42.  The account name is 
ER2 and the password can be obtained by calling the AES.
