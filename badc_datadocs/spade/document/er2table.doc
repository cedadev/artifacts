ER2TABLE.DOC   (1994-01-12 - pgh)


The following table indicates the ER-2 files, the P.I. (or P.I.'s) 
responsible for generating the data, and the two-character file name
prefix for each type of file that are contained on this final release
of SPADE datasets.  The following letters are used to indicate the 
status of each file:

No distinction is made as to why a particular dataset is not available. Some 
blanks are a result of a temporary instrument failure.  In other cases there 
may be data available for a given flight, but for whatever reason the PI 
could not assure its reliability and therefore did not include it in this 
release.
