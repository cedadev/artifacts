The following is a brief summary of period when ATSR data was not available or
should be handled with care.  The summary is for the period between launch of
ERS-1 to date.  At all other time ATSR was nominal.  The normal configuration
for ATSR was that 12.0 and 11.0 channels are always packed into the telemetry 
stream, while the 3.7 is packed during night-time and 1.6 during day-time. 
This remained in effect until the 3.7um channel failed on 27 May 1992, after
which time the 1.6um channel was always packed.

		unavailable between 317:18:55:39 and 318:08:30:00 UTC.

		No IRR or MWR data during this period.

		Due to a procedural discrepancy, on reconfiguration the 
		wrong compression mode was selected AND the 1.6/3.7 AUTOCAL
		was turned ON. 

13-16/24 Nov 92	1.6 channel gain incorrectly being controlled by the
		(failed) 3.7 AUTOCAL, resulting in unstable 1.6 data.
		from 318:08:30:00 to 321:10:19:00 UTC. The correct
		compression mode was then reselected at the start
		of the planned outgassing which commenced at

		IRR science data is not available between :-
		329:12:46:51 and 331:18:24:07 UTC.

12 Dec 92	Due to an unexpected tape recorder Beginning of Tape
		(BOT), the tape recording was stoped for low bit rate
		data between 347:22:12:27 and 347:22:59:40.

		No IRR or MWR science data during this period.


16 Dec 92	ERS-1 performed orbit correction manoeuvre.  ERS-1
		not in Yaw Steering Mode between 351:12:53:52 and 
		351:18:45:56. During this period it was not possible
		to maintain nominal pointing accuracy.  For this 
		reason, ERS-1 products during the  period may not
		meet their specification.

			
23 Dec 92	A spurious BOT was detected in the recording 
		period 358:00:34:59 to 358:02:12:13. resulting in

08 Sep 94	Due to an IDHT anomaly LBR data lost between :-
		251:01:47:30 thru' 251:08:06:47 UTC
		251:09:06:21 thru' 251:09:41:51 UTC and lastly
		251:09:49:30 thru' 251:11:28:06 UTC

05 Oct 94	Due to an anomaly the ATSR DEU performed an autonomous
		shutdown, this occurred at 278:03:20:38 UTC. The present
		belief is that this was an SEU as ERS-1 was in the South
		Atlantic Anomaly region at this time. ATSR was left to
		outgass. During recovery the DEU was reset, Cool down
		began on Friday 7th Oct. with the following SCC settings
		Compressor Amplitude 2.171v (AB hex)
		Displacer Amplitude  0.93v  (B3 hex)
		Compressor Frequency 44.37 Hz

08 Oct 94	ATSR resumed "Nominal" operation at :
		281:12:09:51 UTC. The FPA was running at this time 2-3 deg.
		warmer than just prior to the shut down. Fine adjustments 
		to the SCC were made over the next three days. The cooler
		amplitude will be kept at 2.210v (AE).

11 Oct 94       Cooler operating parameters adjusted.	
		SCC Compressor A and B Offsets set to 60 Hex (-0.448v) at
	        284:10:25:11 UTC

12 Oct 94	Cooler operating parameters adjusted.	
		Reset on board limit checking of TMZ716/717
		285:13:01:51 UTC SCC Disp. Phase from 100.1 deg to 97.85 (27H) 
		285:13:01:51 UTC SCC Comp. Amp. from 2.171v to 2.210v (AB to AE)
				 
13 Oct 94       Cooler operating parameters adjusted.	
		286:10:55:00 UTC SCC Freq. adjusted from 44.37 to 45.18Hz. (25H)
		
14 Nov 94	Due to problems with the IDHT no low bitrate data was available
		318:06:18:40 UTC thru'
		318:17:05:30 UTC

20 Nov 94	Due to a spurious BOT on the IDHT tape LBR was lost between:-
		324:09:06:19 UTC and 324:10:09:19 UTC

16 Dec 94	Due to an anomaly the ATSR DEU performed an autonomous
		shutdown, this occurred at 350:00:01 UTC. At the time ERS-1
		was in the process of moving from Yaw Steeering Mode to Fine
		Pointing Mode after a planned orbit manoeuvre. Inspection of
		Telemetry showed the shut down to have been initiated due to
		ATSR health indicator 0,1 and 3 timing out, failing and overunning
		respectively. ATSR ICU correctly issued an EQSOL request to
		the OBC and ATSR was shut down. Further inspection of telemetry
		showed excessive build up of F401 "Sub pixel position adjustment"
		events this had occurred over the preceding 72 hours - these
		events are commonly associated with Scan Mirror jitter. The 
		instrument was left to outgass, as is now our standard procedure.

19/20 Dec 94	During the next two days the ATSR was recovered with particular
		attention being paid to the SMU performance. The scan mirror was
		run for approximately 20 hours before begining the cool down. 
		Cool down commenced on 20th Dec at 09:35 UTC and NOMINAL
		status was achieved at 354:20:57:06 UTC with the SCC operating
		at pre-anomaly settings ( except for compressor amplitude at 2.21v 
		AE HEX, two steps below the pre-anomaly setting) and detectors fully 
		cooled down. Later telemetry indicated though that the 
		autogain/offset loops had not settled down correctly until 21st 
		Dec 355:01:30:00 UTC. Scan mirror "jitter" events cleared up to 
		pre-anomaly rates at approx 20th Dec 354:17:00:00 UTC 
		Data therefore should be usable again from 355:01:30 UTC.

24 Jan 95	Due to an onboard anomaly the IDHT was unavailable from :-
		025:12:47:38 UTC thru 025:16:02:45 UTC No LBR data was 
		collected during this period.	

19 Mar 95	ERS-1 Manoeuvre to change from 168 to 35 day repeat began.
		The platform was in Fine Pointing Mode from approx
		078:10:05:00 UTC through 078:16:50:00 UTC. Data processed
		for this period should be viewed with caution.

21 Mar 95	ERS-1 Manoeuvre finishes today. The platform is expected
		to be in Fine Pointing Mode again from :-
		080:05:40:00 UTC through 080:13:45:00 UTC. Again data
		processed for this period should be viewed cautiously.


31 Mar 95	Black Body Cross Over Test begins to verify the accuracy
		of the emissivities and temperature measurement of the
		on-board calibration black bodies.
		Cross-over began at 090:07:35:57 UTC. The BB temperatures
		had stabilised by 090:20:47:56 UTC. Data between these times
		is not nominal. The black bodies will remain in crossed over
		roles for approx six days.

04 Apr 95	The heater power to the -XBB was changed from MEDIUM to HIGH
		at 094:13:49:49 UTC. This raised the temperature of the 'Hot'
		Black Body from 31 to 36 degrees C.

06 Apr 95	The reverse crossover test to bring the BB configuration
		back to normal began at 096:07:49:37 UTC. The BB temperatures
		had stabilised by 096:21:01:23 UTC. Data between these times
		is not nominal. The ATSR Black Body configuration is now 
		back at the nominal settings as of 31 Mar 95 prior to 07:35 UTC.
	
08 Apr 95	Due to a spurious BOT on the IDHT tape LBR data was lost
		between 098:18:30:03 UTC and 098:18:41:28 UTC.


27 Aug 95	Due to an MPS error the IDHT LBR data was unavailable from
		day 239:01:02:00 UTC to 239:08:17:00 UTC. Ther will be no
		ATSR-1 data between these times.
