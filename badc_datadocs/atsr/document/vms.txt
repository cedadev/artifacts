 This CD-ROM set is written to ISO 9660 standard with no record format
 specified for the files.
 VAX and Alpha systems on VMS Version 6 can deal with ISO standard CDs,
 although the procedure is not totally straightforward.

 There are two types of files are on the CDs.

   a) Text files: That is, all the files in the software and docs
      directories on Disk 1.
   
   b) Data files: That is, all the files in the asst, months and supers 
      directories. These all use fixed-length records with record sizes  
      of 32, 720 or 1440 bytes.

  
   a) Considering text files first: the problem with these is that each
   end of line in the text files on CD is marked by a line feed. 
   These files will look correct on Unix platforms and PCs. However the
   default for VMS is to use carriage return to mark the end of line. 
   Thus the line structure in these files will look wrong and there will 
   be embedded control characters. 
   This problem can be circumvented in several ways.

    1) Mount the CD as shown below:
          $ MOUNT/MEDIA=CD-ROM/UNDEFINED=(STREAM_LF:132) DEVICE "LABEL"

       This causes the system to treat line feeds as ends of lines in 
       the files on the CD.

    or  

    2) Copy all the required text files and then set the file attributes
       as shown:
          $ SET FILE/ATT=(RFM=STMLF) file

       This performs a similar function to the previous command on 
       specified files only.


   b) Reading the data files with C or IDL should prove no problem.
   In both these cases, the data files are just treated as a stream of
   bytes, and the files' record structure is irrelevant.

   However if you want to use the Fortran programs, the record structure
   of the files on the CD must match that expected by the program, that is:

        asst files   -    32-byte fixed length records
        months files -  1440-byte fixed length records
        supers files -   720-byte fixed length records
          
   As the files on the CDs have no specified record structure, this 
   requires that the CD is mounted appropriately.
   For example:

       $ MOUNT/MEDIA=CD-ROM/UNDEFINED=(fixed:none:32) DEVICE "LABEL"

   will cause all files on the CD to have fixed length, 32-byte records,
   with no carriage return marking the end of line. This will enable the
   Fortran programs to read the asst files.
   Unfortunately, should you require to read the months or supers files
   with Fortran, you would need to dismount the disk, and remount replacing
   32 with 720 or 1440 as appropriate.
