This dataset is produced as part of the NOAA/NASA Pathfinder AVHRR Land program (<a
href="references.html#townshend">Townshend, 1994</a>). It contains global 
monthly composites of the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) at 1&deg resolution covering 
the period from July 1981 to September 1994. This monthly climate dataset was recently updated, since 
the original data (the 8 km x 8 km 10-day composite) used for generating this monthly dataset was 
recently reprocessed. 
The Pathfinder Program produces long-term datasets derived from the observations made by Advanced Very 
High Resolution Radiometers (AVHRR) on the "afternoon" NOAA operational meteorological satellites 
(NOAA-7, -9, 11) and processed in a consistent manner for global change research.

</a>
 
This dataset is a collection of monthly composites of ocean chlorophyll concentration derived from the 
Coastal Zone Colour Scanner (CZCS) instrument flown aboard the Nimbus-7 satellite from October 1978 
through June 1986. This concentration provides a direct measure of the abundance of phytoplankton and 
its variability in space and time over most of the world's oceanic regions. The CZCS dataset represents 
the only source of satellite-derived, global oceanic biomass productivity, and serves as an important 
precursor to the next generation of advanced ocean colour instruments (<a href="references.html#feldman">
Feldman et al., 1989</a>). These include the Sea-Viewing 
Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWiFS), launched on August 1, 1997, and future missions conducted as part of 
NASA's Mission to Planet Earth program.

</a>
 
Land cover is described in terms of 13 vegetation types plus water, ice and bare desert soil.  Phenological 
differences among vegetation types, reflected in temporal variations in NDVI derived from 
satellite data, have been used to classify land cover at continental scales. This study explored 
methodologies for extending this concept to a global scale (<a href="references.html#defries">DeFries and 
Townshend 1994a</a>). A coarse 
resolution (1&deg x 1&deg) dataset of monthly NDVI values for 1987 (<a href="references.html#los">Los et al.
1994</a>, <a href="references.html#sell94">Sellers, et al. 
1994</a>, &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="references.html#sell95b">1995b</a>) was used as the basis for a supervised 
classification of eleven cover types that broadly 
represent the major biomes of the world. Because of missing values at high latitudes, the Pathfinder 
AVHRR dataset for 1987 (<a href="references.html#james">James and Kalluri, 1994</a>) for summer monthly 
NDVI and red reflectance values 
were used to distinguish the following cover types: tundra, high latitude deciduous forest and woodland, 
coniferous evergreen forest and woodland.<br>
<br>
The land cover dataset was further modified to be consistent with the SiB vegetation classes described 
in <a href="references.html#dorman">Dorman and Sellers, (1989)</a>, <a href="references.html#sell95a">Sellers 
et. al. (1995a)</a> and <a href="references.html#sell95b">Sellers et. al. (1995b)</a>.  This dataset is 
also available on the <b><i>ISLSCP Initiative I CD-ROM set</b></i>.
