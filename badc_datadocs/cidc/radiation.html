This dataset is a collection of monthly means of outgoing longwave radiation derived from the Earth
Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) scanning instruments aboard the ERBS, NOAA-9, and NOAA-10 satellites.  It
was created from regional, zonal and global gridded averages (ERBE S-4G) data product, and covers the years
1986 - 1988.  More years are expected to be added as data is regridded, please refer to the DAAC <a
href="ftp://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/inter_disc/radiation_clouds/erbe_rad/"> Outgoing
Longwave Radiant Flux FTP site</a>.<br>
<br>
The Earth Radiation Budget Experiment is a system of satellites designed to measure the Earth's energy
balance.  Its goal is to provide accurate measurements of incoming solar radiation and shortwave radiation
reflected or emitted from the Earth back into space.  The Earth's radiation budget is the primary indicator of
global climate change.  The absorbed shortwave radiation (incident minus reflected) fuels the Earth's climate
and biosphere systems.  The longwave radiation represents the exhaust heat emitted to space.  It can be used
to estimate the insulating effect of the atmosphere (the greenhouse effect).  It is also a useful indicator
of cloud amount and activity.

</a>
 
Total solar irradiances are presented for the period November 16, 1978 through December 31, 1997. The 
measurement
program is continuing and additional years will be added as they become available. This irradiance 
provides 
the energy that powers the Earth's climate and biosphere. It had long been suspected that the solar energy 
emitted towards the Earth varied with time but this was not definitely demonstrated until accurate, 
self-calibrating pyrheliometers flown on satellites began to regularly monitor the Sun (<a
href="references.html#refhick">Hickey et al., 1980</a>). 
The measured solar variations are of the order of fractions of a percent and atmospheric transmission 
problems had previously limited the accuracy of ground based measurements (<a href="references.html#refwill">
Willson, 1984</a>). Data from four 
experiments are included here: The Nimbus-7 Earth Radiation Budget (ERB) measurements (November 1978 -
December 1993), the Active Cavity Radiometer Irradiance Monitor I (ACRIM I) measurements (February 1980 -
July 1989) on the Solar Maximum Mission (SMM), the solar monitor measurements (October 1984 - June 1996) 
on the Earth Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBS), and the ACRIM II measurements (October 1991 - December 1996) 
on the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS). ACRIM I & II was replaced by the final version which now 
runs through December 1997. Both daily and monthly mean 
values are given from the Nimbus-7 ERB (<a href="references.html#hoyt">Hoyt et al., 
1992</a>), ACRIM I & II (<a href="references.html#willson">Willson, 1994</a>),
and the ERBS/ERBE (<a href="references.html#lee">Lee, 1995</a>) measurement programs, and cover the area of 
the solar disk.  For ease of comparison all the measurements are converted to the value that would be 
obtained at the mean annual Earth to Sun distance.

</a>
 
Clouds play an important role in the climate change by affecting the heat exchange between the Sun, 
Earth and atmosphere. They also modulate the solar irradiance incident on the Earth's surface 
(the insolation) and this affects the productivity of plants both on land and in the water as well 
as the surface temperature and heat budget. Numerous efforts to form cloud climatologies from both 
surface and satellite observations have been made. At present the most important of these is the 
ongoing International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (<a href="http://isccp.giss.nasa.gov/">ISCCP</a>), established in 1982 as part of the 
World Climate Research Program (WCRP). A combination of satellite-measured radiances, ice/snow cover 
datasets and TOVS atmospheric temperature/humidity are used by ISCCP to produce a global dataset on 
cloud and surface variables. Operational data collection and processing for ISCCP have been underway 
since July 1983. An overview of the project and the data products is given in <a
href="references.html#refross">Rossow and Schiffer (1991)</a>; 
the algorithm and its effectiveness are described by <a href="references.html#R&Ga">Rossow and Garder
(1993a&b)</a> while <a href="references.html#rossow">Rossow et al.
(1993)</a> compare the resulting products to other cloud climatologies. The ISCCP C2-series data products, 
briefly described here (more extensively in <a href="references.html#rossetal">Rossow et al. (1996)</a>), 
are gridded data averaged over each 
month. These data (spanning over the period July 1983 to June 1991) are originally produced on an equal 
area map grids which has a constant 2.5&deg latitude increments and variable longitude increments 
ranging from 2.5&deg at the equator to 120&deg at the pole. The Goddard DAAC has regridded these 
datasets to 1&deg x 1&deg equal angle grid for inclusion in the Interdisciplinary data collection.

Cloud cover is an extremely important climate parameter. Although only some clouds bring precipitation, 
all affect the heat exchange between the Sun, Earth and cold space, and they are also quite variable in 
time, from region to region, and in the effects they produce. Clouds modulate the solar irradiance 
incident on the Earth's surface (the insolation) and this affects the productivity of plants both on 
land and in the water as well as the surface temperature and heat budget. Numerous efforts to produce 
cloud climatologies from both surface and satellite observations have been made. At present the most 
important of these is the ongoing International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project 
(<a href="http://isccp.giss.nasa.gov/">ISCCP</a>). A combination of satellite-measured radiances, TOVS 
atmospheric temperature/humidity and ice/snow data are used by ISCCP to produce a global dataset on 
cloud and surface variables. An overview of the Project and the data products is given in <a

while <a href="references.html#rossow">Rossow et al. (1993)</a> compare the resulting products to other cloud 
climatologies. The ISCCP D-series, which is described more extensively in <a href="references.html#rossetal">
Rossow et al. (1996)</a>, is a revised version of the C-series dataset. The ISCCP D2-series products are 
gridded data averaged over each month. These datasets (presently covering the period 1986-1987 & 1989-1992) 
are originally produced on an equal area map grids which has a constant 2.5&deg latitude increments and 
variable longitude increments ranging from 2.5&deg at the equator to 120&deg at the pole. The Goddard 
DAAC has regridded a subset (36 out of the original 130 parameters) of these dataset to 1&deg x 1&deg equal 
angle grid for inclusion in the Climatology Interdisciplinary Data Collection (CIDC).

The surface radiation budget (SRB) is a basic climate and biosphere parameter which affects the surface 
heat and moisture budget as well as biological productivity. This dataset covers the spectral range of 
0.2-50 micrometers, and is divided into two regions: shortwave (SW, 0.2-5.0 micrometers) and thermal longwave
(LW, 5.0-50 micrometers). Both the downward and net radiation at the surface are given. It consists of 
monthly means covering the period (July 1983-June 1991) and was developed by the Radiation Sciences Branch 
of the Atmospheric Sciences Division at NASA Langley Research Center, Hampton, Virginia. The irradiances 
are calculated using computationally fast radiative transfer algorithms whose primary input data come 
from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (<a href="http://isccp.giss.nasa.gov/">ISCCP</a>) 
C1 products (<a href="references.html#darnell">Darnell et al., 1996</a>; <a href="references.html#refross">
Rossow and Schiffer, 1991</a>). This dataset, like the ISCCP products, 
was developed on an equal area world grid (about 280 km by 280 km). The data has been regridded to a 1&deg x 1&deg grid for easy comparison with the other Climatology Interdisciplinary Data 
Collection parameters. There have been extensive validation efforts, including comparisons with surface 
measurements (<a href="references.html#gupta">Gupta et al., 1993a</a>; <a
href="references.html#whitlock">Whitlock et al., 1995</a>; and <a href="references.html#darnell">Darnell et
al., 1996</a>). <a href="references.html#pinker">Pinker et al. (1995)</a> 
discuss a number of research fields in which this data will be very useful. The Global Energy and 
Water-cycle Experiment (GEWEX) SRB Project chose the Langley short- and long-wave SRB algorithms as one 
pair of two shortwave and two longwave algorithms to produce SRB fluxes for the twelve year study period 
(July'83 through June'95).

Irradiance from NASA GISS</h2>

The surface solar irradiance (250-4000 nm) is a basic climate and biosphere parameter which affects 
the surface temperature and photosynthesis in both marine and land plants. It is also important to 
geochemical cycling because both biological and photochemical processes strongly perturb distributions 
of chemical species on land and in the ocean. Clouds are a major modulator of the surface solar 
irradiance. <a href="references.html#bishop">Bishop and Rossow (1991)</a> developed a fast radiative transfer algorithm for calculating 
the downwelling surface solar irradiance which uses the total cloud amount from the International 
Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (<a href="http://isccp.giss.nasa.gov/">ISCCP</a>) as an important input 
parameter. Their algorithm has gone 
through three versions, reprocessing using the version 3 algorithm is in progress. Eight years 
(July '83 - June '91) of monthly downward surface solar irradiance (W/m<sup>2</sup>) calculated using version 
2 algorithm are presented here.  The original data was on a 2.5&deg x 2.5&deg grid, which has been 
interpolated to a 1&deg x 1&deg grid.
