The dataset consists of 1&deg x 1&deg world gridded monthly averaged total column ozone. It is derived from 
the Nimbus-7 Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) monthly averaged total column ozone data gridded at 1.25&deg x 1&deg longitude-latitude. 
The Nimbus-7 TOMS data is the only source of high resolution global information about the total 
ozone content of the atmosphere for the period November 1, 1978 - May 6, 1993 (<a href="references.html#mc">McPeters et al., 1996</a>). The ozone dataset was 
produced by the Ozone Processing Team (OPT) of the Atmospheric Chemistry and Dynamics Branch at the Goddard
Space Flight Centre, using final Nimbus-7, Version 7, OPT data reduction 
algorithm, and was released in the Spring of 1996. This ozone dataset is important in studies involving 
atmospheric chemistry and upper air dynamics on both short (interannual) and long (decadal) time scales.

 Greenhouse Gases from CDIAC</h2>
</a>
 
Precise records of past and present atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) 
and nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) concentrations are critical to studies attempting to understand 
the effects these gases have on climate change. Researchers have attempted to determine past levels of 
the atmospheric gases by a variety of techniques, including direct measurements of trapped air in polar 
ice cores, indirect determinations from carbon isotopes in tree rings, analysis of spectroscopic data, 
and measurements of carbon and oxygen isotopic changes in carbon sediments in deep-ocean cores. The 
modern period of precise atmospheric measurements began during the International Geophysical Year (1958) 
with Keeling's (Scripps Institution of Oceanography) pioneering determinations at Mauna Loa, Hawaii 
and at the South Pole. Since that time the number of sites that measure atmospheric gases has grown to 
over sixty sites on both the land surface and ocean. <br>
<br>
This dataset describes Atmospheric Chemistry records and isotope temperature records acquired from the Carbon 
Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC) Trends '93: A Compendium of Data on Global Change. Trends '93 
is part of CDIAC continuing effort to distribute, in an accessible format, scientific data critical 
to global-change issues.<br>
<br> 
This subset of the Trends '93 collection includes the following:
<p style="margin-left:1.2em">
<ul>
<li> Historical CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> records from the Vostok and Siple Station ice cores. 
<li>Historical isotope temperature records from Vostok ice cores. 
<li>Atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> records from sites in Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) air sampling network. 
<li>Atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> records from sites in NOAA'S Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory 
(CMDL) air sampling network. 
<li>Atmospheric N<sub>2</sub>O records from the Atmospheric Lifetime Experiment (ALE) and the Global Atmospheric Gases 
Experiment (GAGE). 
</ul>
<P>

Readers may note that two apparently different systems of units have been used in presenting the 
atmospheric data. For data from ice cores and for some modern atmospheric records, levels are presented 
as concentrations in parts per million by volume (ppmv). For much of the modern data, values are given 
as mixing ratios, in parts per million or in parts per million by volume. These differences in unit 
designations reflect the preferences of the researchers who have contributed their respective data 
sets for inclusion in Trends '93. In the context of atmospheric concentration in parts per million by 
volume refers to the number of volumes of the particular gas (CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub> and
N<sub>2</sub>O) per million volumes of sample. In this same context, mixing ratio in parts per million 
is derived by dividing the number of moles of the particular gas (CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub> and
N<sub>2</sub>O) by the total number of moles in the sample and then multiplying the quotient by one 
million. Assuming that the volume of a gas is proportional to the number of moles contained within 
the volume (this assumption should be valid for a gas (CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub> and
N<sub>2</sub>O) in air under the conditions that atmospheric measurements are routinely carried out), 
we can expect that a gas (CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub> and
N<sub>2</sub>O) concentrations should be equivalent to the same gases mixing ratios. For all practical 
applications, therefore, users of this data should consider the terms concentration and mixing ratio 
to be interchangeable.
