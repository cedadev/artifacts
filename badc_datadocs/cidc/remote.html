This section describes a set of broad spectral band shortwave (0.2 to 4 micron) and longwave (5 to 50 
micron) angular radiation distribution models. The satellite measurements of Earth-atmosphere 
radiations are usually confined to certain local times and specific directions of view depending on 
orbital constraints and instrument scanning capabilities. However, if angular dependence of reflected 
and emitted radiation for a surface are known, the total outgoing flux at the top of the atmosphere 
and the radiations in all directions could be inferred from a single observation (<a href="references.html#ras">
Raschke et al., 1973</a>).<br>
<br> 
Development of angular radiance distribution models has been one of the objectives of the Earth 
Radiation Budget experiment (ERB) on the Nimbus-7 satellite (<a href="references.html#jacob">Jacobwitz et al.,
1984</a>). A comprehensive 
set of angular radiance distribution models presented here (<a href="references.html#suttles88a">Suttles et
al. 1988a</a>, &nbsp <a href="references.html#suttles88b">1988b</a>) have been 
derived primarily from radiances measured between 1978 and 1980 by the Nimbus-7 ERB scanner. In data 
sparse regions the parameters have been estimated including observations from Geostationary Operational 
Environmental Satellite (GOES) because of its better diurnal sampling capability 
(<a href="references.html#minnis84b">Minnis and Harrison, 
1984b</a>). The data gaps were filled by a variety of other techniques including interpolation and extrapolation 
based on the reciprocity principle, some empirical and radiative transfer models (<a href="references.html#suttles88a">Suttles et
al. 1988a</a>, &nbsp <a href="references.html#suttles88b">1988b</a>).<br>
<br>
The parameters of the shortwave angular radiance distribution model consist of both bi-directional 
and directional parameters. The bi-directional parameters are anisotropic factor, standard deviation 
of shortwave (SW) radiances, and shortwave-longwave radiance correlation coefficient as a function 
of 10 solar zenith angle, 7 viewing zenith angle, 8 relative azimuth angle and 12 scene categories. 
The directional parameters are mean albedo as a function of solar zenith angle and mean albedo normalised 
to overhead Sun. <br>
<br>
The longwave angular radiance model parameters are anisotropic factor and standard deviation of longwave 
(LW) radiances as a function of 7 viewing zenith angle, 10 colatitude, 4 season and 12 scene categories. 
The directional parameters are mean daytime longwave flux and (day - night) longwave flux difference 
derived as a function of 10 colatitudes and 4 seasons. The longwave daytime flux difference is given 
only for 10 scene types.<br>
<br>
The angular bi-directional and directional radiation distribution model have been used in the analysis 
of satellite measurements, earth radiation budget studies and in particular by the Earth Radiation Budget 
Experiment (ERBE) team in the ERBE inversion algorithm (<a href="references.html#bark">Barkstrom et al.,
1989</a>) 
as a tool for inferring 
hemispheric fluxes from ERBE radiances (<a href="references.html#smit">Smith et al., 1986</a>; <a
href="references.html#wiel89">Wielicki and Green, 1989</a>).
