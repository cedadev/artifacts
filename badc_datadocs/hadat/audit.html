<h3>Introduction</h3>
<P>This page provides a full audit trail of all the decisions made in 
constructing and updating HadAT. Most users will not require all this 
information.
<P>
This audit trail is designed to be complete and accessible but we always 
welcome feedback that can improve the information presented. An editorial 
decision was made to present this audit trail description as a single long 
page to avoid endless clicking through links. This ensures that all information 
is available in the one place. Large data files are always presented as a choice
 of either ASCII (compressed) or netcdf files. In the netcdf files we have 
attempted to strictly adhere to the <a href="http://www.cfconventions.org">CF 1.0 conventions</a>. Where files are large 
we have always tried to indicate the file size.
<P>
Please note that this webpage should be read in conjunction with the HadAT dataset paper, 
which provides further detail and justification of a number of the technical decisions we 
made. If there are any conflicts then the description in the paper takes precedence unless 
specifically noted otherwise (we may have made mistakes here and as it hasn't been strictly 
peer reviewed they are less likely to have been spotted and rectified).
<P>
Timeseries and information up until HadAT2 data are limited to a seasonal or annual temporal 
resolution and to the beginning of 2002 (when the HadAT homogenisation analysis commenced). 
Only HadAT2 is available on a monthly resolution and updated in near real-time as outlined 
in Section 6.
<a name="network"></a>
<h3>1 - Deriving our initial station network</h3>
There are a wealth of digital radiosonde data sources available now. In this project we limited 
ourselves to what we consider to be the four principal sources. These were: 
<ol>
<li>CLIMAT TEMP - monthly archives on 9 pressure levels held at the Hadley Centre. 
<li>LKS - dataset of 87 quality controlled stations globally distributed courtesy of John Lanzante and 
co-authors, available on 15 levels and at launch resolution (scientific references on front page). 
<li><a href="http://www.guanweb.com/">GUAN</a> - median fit selection of all available station records 
for the GCOS Upper Air Network (GUAN) of 151 stations along with some gross Quality Control checks, 
courtesy of Mark McCarthy, Hadley Centre. Available on 9 pressure levels. 
<li>MONADS - Monthly summary of the Comprehensive Aerological Reference Dataset 
(<a href="http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/igra/index.php">CARDS</a>) from the NOAA, USA. As for LKS these are available on 15 levels and at launch resolution. Please 
note this dataset has recently been replaced with a new dataset, IGRA - see section on real-time updating 
of the HadAT dataset later on. 
</ol>
<p>
We subsampled all datasets to the 9 common levels (850, 700, 500, 300, 200, 150, 100, 50, and 30hPa). 
Only data recorded since 1958, the International Geophysical Year, was used. The reasons are two-fold: 
firstly, coverage dramatically degrades prior to this date and secondly there was a global 3 hour 
shift in observation times (from 0300/1500 UTC to 0000/1200 UTC) in 1957. 
<p>
To date we have limited our analyses to those stations for which it was possible to create a 1966-1995 
climatology for at least one level and one of the digital sources considered. To create a climatology 
required a monthly value for a given month (e.g. December) to exist for at least 5 years of each decade 
over the climatology period. A full listing of these stations is given as part of the file 
<A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/ukmo-hadat/doc/hadat_station_information.txt">hadat_station_information.txt</a> 
which is supplementary table 1 in Thorne et al., 2005. For a description of the file contents please read the 
<A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/ukmo-hadat/doc/JGR_readme.doc">JGR readme file</a>. 


<p>
We used annual layer thickness anomaly timeseries for the troposphere (700 to 300hPa) and the 
stratosphere (300 to 100hPa) to define a set of station series that were grossly consistent with 
a core network of LKS (87 station network) and GUAN stations that had been previously analysed and 
quality controlled. A small subset of these LKS and GUAN stations were found to be dubious in 
comparison to their "neighbours" and were deleted completely or in part - details are given in 
<A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/ukmo-hadat/data/HadAT0/hadat_supplementary2.txt">supplementary information Table 2</a> (again see the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/ukmo-hadat/doc/JGR_readme.doc">JGR readme file</a>).  
<p>
Decisions as to inclusion in our first station set were based upon the similarity 
of the station series to the resulting modified neighbour thickness composites in 
the troposphere and the stratosphere (see section 3.1 in Thorne et al., 2005). The 
decisions are given in the microsoft excel file <A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/ukmo-hadat/doc/newerdecisions.xls">
decisions.xls</a>. Please note that this 
file contains a suite of visual basic macros. These do not need to be enabled for 
the file to be viewed. Please see the README sheet in this file for further explanation 
of how to interpret the results.
<p><a name="raw"></a>
<h3>2. HadAT0 - raw station and gridded products</h3>
The raw data that result from the decisions outlined in Section 1 were converted to seasonal 
mean anomaly timeseries on our nine pressure levels relative to a 1966-95 climatology. 
These series were gridded onto a 10 degree longitude by 5 degree latitude grid to form HadAT0. 
These are the "raw" station level data used as input to our QC procedure. In reality they are 
all post-processed to some extent. For CLIMAT TEMP and MONADS this post-processing is whatever 
was performed at the station plus gross QC checks. For GUAN there has been a median fit selection 
applied to all stations between data from CLIMAT TEMP and MONADS and some National Met Service 
archives, along with gross QC checks. LKS has had a much more thorough examination of the raw data 
to produce a high quality dataset which is available from John Lanzante at NOAA GFDL. The station 
sources used for each station are listed as part of <A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/ukmo-hadat/doc/hadat_station_information.txt">hadat_station_information.txt</a> 
.
<P>
<a href="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/ukmo-hadat/data/HadAT0/">HadAT0 Data files</a> are available in the ukmo-hadat archive.
<P><a name="quality"></a>
<h3>3. Quality Control on HadAT0 station timeseries</h3>
A weighted average neighbour series was constructed on each pressure level for each of the HadAT0 
stations (see Thorne et al., 2005 for more details) based upon all surrounding neighbour stations, 
with our stratospheric neighbours consisting only of those stations which had not failed the 
stratospheric similarity tests in our initial assessment (<A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/ukmo-hadat/data/HadAT0/stratospheric_ids.txt">listing</a> of stratospheric neighbour 
stations). The <a href="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/ukmo-hadat/data/HadAT0/">neighbour coefficients</a> 
used to calculate the average neighbour series can be found 
in the BADC archive (Note: these files contain neighbour coefficients for additional stations as well as the HadAT0 
stations - see section 5)
<P>
We analysed the station minus neighbour average difference series with the aid of a Kolomogorov-Smirnov 
test applied over a moving 30-season window to make our assessments as to break-point locations and the 
adjustments to be applied. We also used available <a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/igra/index.php?name=metadata">metadata</a> to help us in our decisions as well as our 
knowledge of events such as volcanoes, ENSO etc. Further details are given in Thorne et al. 2005 
description of the dataset construction. This step inevitably involved subjective decisions being made 
as to the timing and existence of breakpoints within the individual station series.
<P>
We used an iterative approach whereby the adjustments were calculated and deletions for gross errors 
identified. These were then applied; the station, neighbours, and neighbour difference series 
recalculated; and the procedure repeated until all stations were deemed to be sufficiently similar to 
their neighbour based estimates. Again, more details are available in Thorne et al., 2005. Adjustments 
were calculated using a bootstrap-type approach and were only assigned if a number of tests were passed, 
as described in Thorne et al., 2005.
<P>
The formatting of the adjustments files is described in the file <a href="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/ukmo-hadat/data/HadAT0/format_adjustments_files.txt">format_adjustments_files.txt</a>. 
The files for each iteration of our procedure are linked below: 
<ul>
<li><a href="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/ukmo-hadat/data/HadAT0/adjustments1.txt">adjustments1.txt</a> 
<li><a href="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/ukmo-hadat/data/HadAT0/adjustments2.txt">adjustments2.txt</a> 
<li><a href="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/ukmo-hadat/data/HadAT0/adjustments3.txt">adjustments3.txt</a>

<li><a href="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/ukmo-hadat/data/HadAT0/adjustments5.txt">adjustments5.txt</a> 
</ul>
<p>
The final adjustments which are the sum of all deletions and adjustments given in the above files 
are given in the files <a href="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/ukmo-hadat/data/HadAT1/hadat1_adjustments.nc">hadat1_adjustments.nc (3.1 Mb)</a> 
and <a href="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/ukmo-hadat/data/HadAT1/hadat1_adjustments.txt.gz">hadat1_adjustments.txt.gz 
(2.3 Mb, compressed)</a>. Adjustments have been applied as a seasonally invariant change to all data 
preceding the breakpoint identified and are addative. Note that as necessary these station series 
have been renormalised at each iteration and in these final files so that they all have a zero 1966-95 
climatology. These climatology adjustments are given in the files.
<p><a name="hadat1"></a>
<h3>4. HadAT1 - homogenised station and gridded timeseries</h3>
The adjustments outlined in Section 3 were applied to the HadAT0 station timeseries data. 
These series were gridded onto a 10 degree longitude by 5 degree latitude grid to form HadAT1. 
<P>
<a href="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/ukmo-hadat/data/HadAT1/">HadAT1 Data files</a> are available in the ukmo-hadat archive.
<P><a name="hadat2"></a>
<h3>5. Expanding the station network to create HadAT2</h3>
As is evident from the analysis in section 1, and summarised in the excel spreadsheet 
<a href="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/ukmo-hadat/doc/newerdecisions.xls">decisions.xls</a>, 
in defining our original set of candidate stations we had chosen to discard a large number of stations. 
These were originally discarded as the thickness series for each station was not considered to be 
significantly similar to a neighbour-average thickness series. They may have introduced gross 
inhomgeneties into the series containing the core set of stations. Figure 1 of Thorne et al., 2005 
shows that the decisions were far from random. In particular we had rejected a large amount of Indian, 
Chinese, African, and tropical data. The importance of many of these regions in attempting to explain 
apparently disparate trends between the surface and the troposphere meant that we revisited these 
stations. These additional stations were incorporated in HadAT2. The decisions as to which station 
version to pick for HadAT2 were based upon the excel spreadsheet, but are not documented within the 
spreadsheet itself. The dataset source choice can be ascertained through an examination of the 
<A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/ukmo-hadat/doc/hadat_station_information.txt">JGR 
supplementary table 1</a>.
<P>
The raw station timeseries are available as 
<a href="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/ukmo-hadat/data/HadAT2/Stations/hadat2_raw_stations.nc">hadat2_raw_stations.nc</a> (1.3 Mb) or

(0.5 Mb, compressed).
<P>
To homogenise these station timeseries we used HadAT1 as a neighbour network, with all HadAT1 stations 
contributing to the stratospheric neighbours. (See section 3 for the neighbour coefficients). In all 
other respects our procedure was identical to that employed in HadAT1. The formatting of the adjustments 
files is also identical to that employed for HadAT1 
(see <a href="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/ukmo-hadat/data/HadAT2/Stations/format_adjustments_files.txt">format_adjustments_files.txt).

<P>
The adjusted HadAT2 stations were added to the HadAT1 station series to create HadAT2.

<H3>6. Updating HadAT2 as a monthly product</H3>
Up until now all of the analysis has been performed on a seasonal or coarser temporal resolution and 
only up until early 2002 when the HadAT homogenisation process was initiated. However, for the purposes 
of monitoring long-term changes it is useful to disaggregate this to the monthly resolution and update 
in near real-time. HadAT0 and HadAT1 remain frozen seasonal products to 2001, but HadAT2 has been 
updated as a monthly product. 
<P>
The final set of seasonal HadAT2 adjustments were applied to the raw monthly anomaly values that were 
originally used do derive the seasonal values. Deletions were applied to all three monthly values 
within each deleted season. The 1966-1995 climatologies were then recalculated to create the HadAT2 
monthly product. 
<P>
Some of the original HadAT data sources are now unsuitable for updating HadAT2. GUAN is only available 
until 2001, the CARDS (and hence MONADS) dataset is no longer being updated, and the LKS dataset only 
contains data until 1997. The CARDS sucessor, Integrated Global Radiosonde Archive (<a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/igra/index.php">IGRA</a>), has therefore 
been used to update the HadAT2 stations which orginally contained data from GUAN and LKS as well as 
MONADS. A comparison between MONADS and IGRA data for a selection of HadAT2 stations showed no 
significant systematic differences on monthly timescales.
<P>
The HadAT2 monthly product was frozen until December 1999 and has been updated with new data from 
January 2000 onwards. The exception was the stations that originally contained data from the LKS 
dataset, as these were updated from January 1998 (see section 1 for a list of stations and sources). 
The new absolute temperature data was converted into anomaly space by subtracting the monthly station 
climatologies below. The monthly gridded climatologies are also available. (<strong>Warning: Climatology values 
may contain absolute biases as the homogenisation analysis is performed in anomaly space so cannot 
perfectly correct for absolute biases</strong>).
<P><a href="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/ukmo-hadat/data/HadAT2/Stations/">HadAT2 Station Climatologies Data files</a> are available in the ukmo-hadat archive.
<P><a href="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/ukmo-hadat/data/HadAT2/Climatologies/">HadAT2 Gridded Climatologies Data files</a> are available in the ukmo-hadat archive.

<P>
To produce fully homogeneous dataset it was deemed necessary to develop some basic quality checks, 
similar to the ones employed in the initial seasonal dataset development. A neighbour difference 
series was calculated, as in the original quality control proceedure. A running first difference 
series was produced using 12 months values either side of each point, and a critical value was derived 
at each station and level from the 95th percentile of the pre-2000 absolute values of this series 
(which are assumed homogeneous following the completion of the QC). Any points within the new post-2000 
data that exceeded this critical value at 3 or more pressure levels were flagged as being a suspected 
breakpoint. Manual intervention was required make the decision whether to adjust each of these potential 
breakpoints, by analysing plots of the difference series. See Figure 2 in the <a href="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/ukmo-hadat/doc/update_report.pdf">report on the updating of 
HadAT in near real-time</a> for an example.
<P>
The adjustments were calculated using the same method as in the orignal dataset development (see Thorne 
et al., 2005 for more details). A period of up to 3 years (36 months) either side of each breakpoint 
(trucated if there was another breakpoint identified within this period) was used unless the breakpoint 
identified was within the most recent 36 months. In these cases a period of 1 year (12 months) was used, 
although the adjustments will be recalculated in subsequent updates when a full 36 months worth of data 
following the breakpoint become available. No breakpoints are identified within the most recent 12 months 
as a 24-month window is required for their identification.
<P>
Each adjustment was subtracted from all the points in the station series after and including the identified 
breakpoint (Note: post-200 adjustments are subtacted and not added). Hence our monthly HadAT2 product has 
been adjusted to December 1999. The neighbour difference series was recalculated and any spurious values 
after 2000 that were equal to or greater than 3.5 standard deviations of the pre-2000 data were 
automatically deleted. The pre-2000 HadAT2 monthly product was combined with the new quality controlled 
data (post-2000) to create the updated HadAT2 monthly product. 
<P><a name="realtime"></a>
<h3>7. HadAT2 near real time updates</h3>
<P>
<img src="update_process_thumb.png" align="right"></a>
<P>HadAT2 is now updated in near real time on a quarterly basis. Each quarter the previous 12 months of data 
is retrieved from the IGRA and CLIMAT TEMP databases. The temperatures are converted to anomalies using 
the monthly climatologies. 
<P>
The raw station monthly timeseries that have been used to update HadAT2 are available as update_raw_stations.
nc (2.2 Mb) or update_raw_stations.txt.gz (compressed, 1.1 Mb). (Note: These files are updated periodically 
when HadAT2 is updated. All stations have been updated with data from January 2000 with the exception of 
the LKS stations, which have been updated from January 1998 - see section 6 above.) 
<P>
Any previously calculated adjustments are applied to the anomalies (except those which require recalculating 
with the full 36 months of data either side of the identfied breakpoint). The anomalies are then passed 
through our quality control system, as described in the section above. 
<P>
The formatting of the update adjustment files is described in the file 

<P><a href="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/ukmo-hadat/data/format_update_adjustment_file.txt">format_update_adjustment_file.txt</a>. 

The file itself is linked below (Note: this file is updated periodically when HadAT2 is updated). 
<P>
<ul>
<li><a href="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/ukmo-hadat/data/update_adjustments.txt">update_adjustments.txt</a> 
</ul>
The quality controlled data is used to update the current station series, which is then gridded. 
Various other products, including the zonal mean timeseries, the global mean time series and the 
tropical mean timeseries are also created. 
(See the <a href="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/ukmo-hadat/data/">HadAT2 data page</a> for all the monthly HadAT2 products 
that are updated in near real time.) A series of tests (currently under development) are applied to 
the HadAT2 products before the website is updated. There is a typical lag of approximately 2 months 
so that, for example, the data for January becomes available at the end of March or the beginning of 
April. The data is updated quarterly unless a specific request for an update is received. 
 

<p><a name="source"></a>
<h3>2. Small change in source data</h3>
The CLIMAT TEMP monthly radiosonde data is no longer archived at the Met Office Hadley Centre. 
Since May 2007 IGRA data have been used to update all HadAT2 stations if available. 
This only affected a small proportion of the stations, which were previously updated using the CLIMAT TEMP archives (see <a href="http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadat/audit/hadat_station_information.txt">hadat_station_information.txt</a>). No significant systematic differences were found on monthly timescales due to this change in source data.
