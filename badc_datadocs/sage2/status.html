More information about the data is available at
the <A HREF="http://www-sage2.larc.nasa.gov/data/">SAGE II</A> web site
at NASA Langley Research Center. The up-to-date data should be
retrieved from there, although we will give access to authorised users
who wish to browse the data. Data continues to be added to the data set.

<Li> <B>March 2005</b>: Version 6.2 data available from BADC.<BR>
<LI> <B>October 2003</b>: Version 6.2 data are available from Langley.<BR>
The update from 6.1 to 6.2 rectifies an altitude
registration problem, and there is an improvement to the water
vapour product. More information about these data is available at
the <A HREF="http://www-sage2.larc.nasa.gov/data/v6_data">SAGE II Version 6.2</A> web site
at NASA Langley Research Center.

<LI> <B>July 2000</B>: a problem with the azimuth gimbal system occurred. This was
corrected and operations resumed at a lower level in November 2000.
</LI>
<LI> <B>Version 6.1</B> data are available from October 1984 through July 2000,
in the form of index files and spec files, with software to assist
processing in IDL. The software routines can be retrieved from the
BADC site, on request.
</LI> 
<LI> <B>Version 1</B> contained SAGE II monthly mean global color image maps and 
the relevant gridded data for aerosol extinction at 1020 nm, 525 nm, 453 nm 
and 385 nm wavelength, ozone mixing 
ratio, water vapor mixing ratio and relative humidity,  
nitrogen dioxide mixing ratio at
up 14 pressure levels, for the period January 1985 to December 1993. Available on a CD-ROM. 
</LI>
<LI> Because the original SAGE II measurements are made 
at geometrical heights, meteorological data from the National Meteorological 
Center (NMC) were used to determine the actual pressure heights for the 
SAGE II profile data and also have been used to calculate the relative 
humidity. For easy reference, the NMC atmospheric temperature, 
geometrical altitude and tropopause data used in the determination of SAGE 
II data are also included. Users of this CD-ROM image/data products need to 
be aware that these meteorological data are not measured by the SAGE II 
instrument itself.
