README.DOC  (1995-06-02)

1.  Introduction

    This CD-ROM contains data pertaining to the combined experiment:
    Airborne Southern Hemisphere Ozone Experiment; and Measurements
    for Assessing the Effects of Stratospheric Aircraft (ASHOE/MAESA).
    This experiment was conducted in four phases between March and 
    November 1994 at NASA Ames Research Center, California; Barbers Point, 
    Hawaii; and Christchurch, New Zealand.  Most of the data are essentially
    in their final form, but additional calibrations are being done for some
    instruments.  A second edition incorporating any changes to the datasets
    is anticipated in mid 1996.
 
    The data consist of in situ and remotely sensed measurements collected
    onboard the NASA ER-2 aircraft; radiosonde, ozonesonde, and backscatter
    sonde balloon measurements; ground-based spectrometer and lidar
    measurements; and SAGE II satellite measurements.
    Theory teams provided calculations of: meteorological parameters in the
    form of partial hemispheric analyses, cross-sections along the ER-2
    flight track, interpolations to the ER-2 flight path, and back-
    trajectories of selected parcels along the ER-2 flight path;
    photodissociation rates of selected chemical species along the ER-2
    flight path; and cloud properties along the ER-2 flight track.

    All investigators produced either measurements or modelling results, 
    though not all products were submitted to the archive.  If there is an
    investigation of interest for which no data is available on this CD-ROM
    archive, please feel free to contact the Principal Investigator directly.
    For example, Dr. D. Johnson, University of Wisconsin, has model results
    from his hybrid forecast model which he is willing to provide to people
    that contact him.  The project handbook, included in the document 
    directory and described below, describes all instrumental and theoretical
    investigations.

    All files within this release are standard ASCII files with variable 
    length records terminated by a carriage return/line feed pair (<CR><LF>,
    ASCII decimal values 13 and 10).  Therefore, MS-DOS users should be able
    to read them as they are, but UNIX and Mac users will have to strip off 
    either the <CR> or the <LF> from each line to convert them to standard 
    UNIX or Mac text files.  Commercially available software, such as 
    dos2unix and Apple File Exchange, exists to convert MS-DOS files to both
    UNIX and Mac files.  DEC VMS users can define the files to have STREAM 
    record formats.
 
    The file naming convention uses a two-character prefix followed by a six 
    digit number (yymmdd) giving the year, month, and day (UT) on which the
    data begins.  For files pertaining to a particular ER-2 flight, such as
    those in the er2 subdirectory, the date in the file name is the UT date
    of launch.  In some files, like those in the ground subdirectory, the
    data starts on the date in the file name but extends for many days.
    A three character extension is used to identify the measurement
    platform or source.  Those with two digits (e.g. Bhh) indicate the
    UT hour to which the data pertains.


2.  Directories

    2.1  The document directory contains several files documenting the 
         contents of this edition.

         Files:

         2.1.1  contact.doc contains an updated list of names, addresses,
                and phone numbers of the principal investigators and/or
                those responsible for generating the datasets in this 
                release.

         2.1.2  EOM.ps is a PostScript file containing the End of Mission
                Statement for ASHOE/MAESA.  This document summarizes the
                objectives and significant findings of the campaign based
                on preliminary analysis of the data during the field phase
                of the mission.

         2.1.3  er2table.doc contains a record of the available ER-2 
                datasets in tabular format.

         2.1.4  fltcat.doc contains a tabular summary of the ASHOE/MAESA
                flights, compiled by Adrian Tuck, ASHOE Project Scientist.

         2.1.5  forspec1.ps and forspec2.ps are PostScript files of the
                document entitled "Format Specification for Data Exchange"
                which defines the standard file formats in which all data 
                are recorded.  forspec1.ps contains the title page and table
                of contents; forspec2.ps contains the bulk of the document.

         2.1.6  handbook.ps is a PostScript file containing the project
                handbook.  This document describes the mission objectives,
                mission plan, aircraft instruments, and theoretical 
                investigations.  It can be printed on a PostScript printer
                (67 pp.), but some PostScript previewers may have problems 
                with some of the special characters within the document.

         2.1.7  uv_vis.doc, by Tom McElroy, contains a detailed description 
                of the UV-Vis experiment, also known as the Composition and 
                Photodissociative Flux Measurement (CPFM).
