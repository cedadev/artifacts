           Description of the UV-VIS Experiment   23/12/93
           ====================================

The Composition and Photodissociative Flux Measurement (CPFM) is made
using a small spectrometer mounted in a wing pod on the right-hand wing 
of the ER-2.  The instrument operates autonomously according to a 
measurement sequence coded into it before flight.  Data are recorded 
using a data assimilation algorithm which runs on a '386, single-board 
computer mounted on the door of the E-bay.  Data are removed from the
computer after each flight and converted from the packed-binary format
stored on-board into a number of useful data formats.

UV-VIS data are collected using a 1024-element photodiode array
spectrophotometer.  Using order separating filters, measurements
are made in the near UV (300 - 387 nm) and in the visible (375 -
775 nm).  The instrument is programmed to make measurements of the
radiation field in several different ways.  These include
measurements of the flux on a horizontal surface, measurements of
the limb brightness at various elevation angles, and observations
of the apparent surface brightness below the aircraft track. 
Horizontal flux measurements, which are done using a teflon
diffuser, are unpolarized.  The limb measurements include two
polarization components, horizontal and vertical.  The nadir
measurement is of the polarization component along the aircraft
track only.  It is to be assumed that the other component is equal
in magnitude to the one measured.  Therefore the total nadir
brightness value is two times the reported one.

The detector outputs, which are measured with an A/D converter, are 
converted to absolute intensity or brightness units using
calibration data from a NIST-traceable quartz-halogen lamp.  In the
case of the diffuser port, the lamp directly illuminates the
entrance surface; in the case of the direct-viewing directions a
certified, reflective diffuser is illuminated by the lamp to
produce a surface of calculable surface brightness.  The
observation data are corrected for the instrument responsivity
using calibrations made using the lamp and diffuser to produce
results in absolute intensity and brightness units.

Data from each viewing direction, for both polarizations, the UV
and visible measurement bands, and from the internal krypton and
neon lamps, are all separately processed.  All the atmospheric data
are scaled using the known responsivity of the instrument.  The
data from the different wavebands are then interpolated and
combined to give a continuous spectrum from 300 nm to about 775 nm. 
For convenience, the data are reported from 300 to 800 in steps of
0.5 nm (1000 points).  The spectrum will always start at 300 nm and
will run to some highest wavelength around 775 nm.  The extra
spectral values, long of the cut-off value, are set to zero.  The
visible data are smoothed before interpolation by a 3 pixel (approx
1.2 nm) FWHM running triangular filter, and the UV by a 5 step
(about 1.0 nm) FWHM filter.  This filtering removes some of the
differences in resolution between the two wavebands which exists
because the UV data are taken in the second order of the
diffraction grating.  The match is not exact because the resolution
of the instrument is partly controlled by the imaging properties of
the grating and is also different at different parts of the spectrum.
The small difference in resolution between the two orders can be seen
in the final spectra.  The last two reported values in the spectrum
are not filtered.

Once the spectra are combined, several other derived quantities are 
calculated.  These include the fluxes within several wavebands, the
column amount of ozone and the photodissociation rate for various
reactions determined from the measured radiation levels.  The
values calculated for the horizontal diffusing surface have the
clearest physical interpretation.  The apparent surface brightness
derived for the other viewing directions must be scaled by
estimates of the solid angles for which the measured brightnesses are
appropriate in order to produce units of effective power per unit
wavelength.

         Data Description for three data product types
         =============================================

Three types of data files have been prepared from the CPFM
observations for the ASHOE flights.  These are complete spectra as
observed, but scaled to true  radiation units, and a number of
derived products which are described below.

1.  File type - US{date}.ea1

     Spectral Irradiance values every 0.5 nm for the flux on the
     horizontal diffuser only.  Spectra form the limb and from the
     nadir are not archived by NASA.

2.  File Type - UV{date}.ea1

     J-values contributions from each observed field, waveband
     integrals and column ozone amounts.

3.  File Type - UP{date}.ea1

     Albedos, integrated (Total) J-value and ozone column amounts.


The spectra (File Type 1) are presented as an ASCII file in Ames format
number 2010 as a sequence of 1000 spectral flux values reported every
half nm.  Only the downward (diffuser) flux values are reported.  The
same housekeeping records which are associated with each block of
derived data (File Type 2), Ames format 1010, are included at the start
of each spectrum.  The spectra have not been corrected for the cosine
dependence of the diffuser, so that the values represent a measurement
of the horizontal flux, not the direct beam irradiance.  The
information given below should serve as a guide to making a correction
to the measured values to estimate the direct beam spectral fluxes. 
The angle between the diffuser normal in flight and the direction of
the vector from the aircraft to the sun has been calculated and is
included in the housekeeping record.

     The reduced data in the UV files are presented in records which
contain measurements of 4 different radiation fields.  Each column in
the table is labeled at the top of the table.  The time in seconds
from the beginning of the day of aircraft launch is included in column
1.  The fourth entry is time in hhmmss where hh is hours, mm is minutes
and ss is seconds GMT (CUT).  The complete data record for one
instrument observation cycle is comprised of 10 lines, two lines for
each field plus the cosine-corrected horizontal flux data.  They are,
in order:

Records in rotation of the following quantities:

     0.  Horizontal flux on upper diffuser surface
         [microwatts per square centimetre per nanometre]
     1.  Vertical polarization component of the Limb brightness at 
         one of ten elevation angles.
         [microwatts per square centimetre per steradian per      
         nanometre]
     2.  Horizontal polarization component of the Limb brightness 
         at one of ten elevation angles.
         [microwatts per square centimetre per steradian per      
         nanometre]
     3.  Nadir surface brightness in the polarization direction   
         along the flight track.  
         [microwatts per square centimetre per steradian per      
         nanometre]

           [it should be noted that the fields to do not come out
           in field order, they come in temporal order to meet the
           Ames file specification.  The time in seconds assigned
           to the cosine-corrected data is forced to be 1 second
           larger that the time of the uncorrected horizontal flux
           record to be consistent with the new interpretation of
           the Ames 1010 format]

  TIME   - time in hhmmss hh- hours, mm - minutes, ss - seconds   
           in C.U.T. (the instrument times are corrected to the
           aircraft reference clock to agree with

           detector diffuser surface (degrees).  If the total flux 
           on the surface were due to the direct solar beam,      
           dividing by the cosine of this angle would             
           provide the normal flux from the solar beam (what a    
           molecule would see from the direct beam).

  SAA    - solar azimuth angle in MET coordinates relative to the 
           limb viewing direction (out the starboard wing).  0 to 
           180 degrees is to the left (toward the nose) and 180 to 
           360 is to the right.

  Roll   - aircraft roll angle.  Positive roll is with the right  
           wing down.

  cO3    - column ozone in m-atm-cm (i.e.: Dobson units).  Has a
           simple interpretation only for the horizontal diffuser port. 
           values should be good down to a solar zenith angle of about
           75 degrees.

  NO2    - J-value contribution for this field (NO2 photolysis
           rate to produce NO + O).  For horizontal diffuser, units of
           inverse seconds, for the others, inverse seconds per steradian.

  OSD -    J-value contribution for this field (O singlet D production
           rate).  For horizontal diffuser, units of inverse seconds,

           [microwatts per cm squared per nm for horizontal diffuser
           and microwatts per cm squared per nm per steradian for the
           other surfaces].

  350 -    average intensity in a waveband from 325 to 350
           [microwatts per cm squared per nm for horizontal diffuser

           other surfaces].

  450 -    average intensity in a waveband from 425 to 475

           other surfaces].

  600 -    average intensity in a waveband from 575 to 625
           [microwatts per cm squared per nm for horizontal diffuser
           and microwatts per cm squared per nm per steradian for the
           other surfaces].

           range [microwatts per cm squared per nm for horizontal flux,
           microwatts per cm squared per nm per steradian for the other
           fields]

       [Note: separate units have not been listed for the cosine-
       corrected field since they are the same as for the uncorrected
       horizontal flux data.]

In order to use the reported data to determine total J-values or
specific power levels for a particular volume, the contribution of
the fields from various directions must be combined.  There are 4
in total: the solar direct beam, the limb contribution (2
polarization components), and the upward flux.

The solar direct beam component.

If the solar direct beam component were the only intensity acting
on the horizontal diffuser, the reported flux could be interpreted
in a very simple  way.  If RZA is the relative solar zenith angle,
that is the angle between the detector (diffuser) surface normal
and the sun direction vector, then the  apparent normal flux, Fn
(microwatts per square centimetre per nanometre), is related to the
direct beam intensity, Fd by the relation Fn = Fd * cos(RZA).  In
practice there are two other components due to the intensities Ih
and Is where Ih is the horizon brightness, and Is is the sky
brightness.  The sky includes approximately 2 PI steradians.  At 20
km altitude the limb occupies about 4.5 degrees of zenith angle,
contributing about 4.5 / 180 * PI radians times 2 PI.  The sensor is
rolled outboard from the vertical by 3.4 degrees (+3.4 degrees in the
MET coordinate system) so the full horizon is not observed.  (The MET 
coordinate system has +x east, +y north and +y up). If the Earth as seen
near the horizon is assumed to be the same brightness as the limb, then
the amount of light seen by the diffuser will increase with roll angle

     Fh = ( 3.4 + roll ) / 180 * 2 * PI^2        for roll > -3.4

            and   Fh = 0.0                       for roll < -3.4

        PI is 3.141592...

The same equation holds for the flux of vertically polarized light,
Fv.

        Clearly, this formulation does not include the fact that
the atmospheric brightness does increase with decreasing altitude.

 Therefore the complete equation using

         Fs = Is * 2 * PI (as above) is:


         Im = Id * cos( RZA ) + Is * 2 * PI + Fh 

Therefore the solar direct beam intensity can only be estimated
given some knowledge of the sky and horizon components.  The
horizon component will, in  general, depend on the azimuth angle of
the sun relative to the aircraft and will also be a function of the
absolute solar zenith angle (SZA).  If some assumption is made of
what the horizon component is, using the above equation for Fh, and
if the sun is reasonably high in the sky (say SZA < 70 degrees)
then the direct beam intensity can be determined from

                   Fd = (Fm - Fh) / cos( RZA )

where it has been assumed that the sky component Fs is negligible. 
In order to  make the best use of the measurements, it is probably
necessary to have a model estimate of the ratio of the direct beam
to the sky, and to use measured values for the horizon component.

     If the horizon component were due to Rayleigh scattering only,
the two  polarization components would vary with relative solar
azimuth angle as the Rayleigh phase function.  That is:

               Iv = Io
               Ih = Io * cos^2( SAA )

      where the total intensity is Ih + Iv
            and SAA is the relative solar azimuth angle.

      With large amounts of aerosol in the upper atmosphere the
true brightness levels can be twice as large at large azimuth
angles and even higher near the solar direction.

      The contribution of light diffusely reflected from the
aircraft has not been included.  This is because it is not
significant.  The aircraft appears to subtend a maximum angle of
about 5 degrees above the position of the CPFM diffuser surface. 
Since the diffuser is rolled outboard by 3.4 degrees this means
that the aircraft is only in view for about 2 degrees.  Since the
contribution is cosine weighted at the diffuser, this will make a
very small additional flux compared to the error in estimating the
horizon contribution.  The aircraft is about 1 radian long (as seen
by the diffuser) and about 0.03 radians high giving a total solid
angle of about 0.03 compared with 0.3 radians for the horizon ( 3.4
/ 180 * 2 * PI^2 ).

      When the sun is high in the sky the total flux which a
molecule sees can be approximated by summing the various
components:

             Ft = Fd + 2 * Fn + Fh + Fv

      The nadir flux, Fn is doubled because only one polarization
is measured and it is assumed that the upwelling radiation is
unpolarized.

      In order to estimate the nadir flux (Fn) properly, it must be
appreciated that the rapid changes in the apparent surface
brightness beneath the aircraft are not directly seen by an air
parcel since the area immediately under the aircraft is only a
small part of the solid angle subtended by the surface under the
flight path.  An average of the apparent surface brightness over a
distance scale representative of the averaging area under the
aircraft should be used.  A solid angle if about PI/2 (or 1/4 of
the full solid angle under the aircraft) is probably
representative.  At an altitude of 20 km, taking 90 degrees as
about 1.5 radians, the surface area seen is 1.5 * 400 square km. 
This gives a linear dimension of 25 km.  With a ground speed of 800
km/hr, 60/16 = 4 minutes of data should be averaged to give a
reasonable estimate half of the surface contribution.  In simple
terms, several nadir measurements should be averaged.  In the albedo
data provided in the UP file no averaging is done; however, it appears
that the scale of the fluctuations is in reasonable agreement with the
variability of OH values measured by the Harvard OH instrument.

      When the sun is high in the sky, the sky and horizon fluxes
can be neglected giving

                       Ft = Fd * cos( SZA )

    clearly the direct beam flux is Fd = Ft / cos( SZA )

One additional instrumental effect is important.  The diffuser
surface does not exactly follow the cosine relation above. 
Therefore the direct beam component which is seen at the diffuser
is actually

        Ft = Fd * cos( SZA ) * correction( wavelength, angle )

      The diffuser used on the CPFM instrument is thin to keep the
transmission high and this results in a direct transmission component
of the radiation is evident at long wavelengths.  The table below shows
the measured performance of the diffuser.  The table is double sided
because of a slight asymmetry in the CPFM foreoptics.  Because of the
wavelength dependence of the diffuser cosine error, the correction to
be applied to each flux integral or J-value will be somewhat dependent
on the wavelengths included and the spectral quality of the light
measured.  The spectra included in the spectral data file can be used
to estimate the error in using a typical wavelength to choose the
effective cosine correction for the flux at a particular zenith angle.
The difference between the horizontal flux entries and the cosine-corrected
values in the UV files includes the correction.  Negative zenith angles
correspond to solar zenith angles on the left side of the aircraft.  This
table will eventually be extended to include an azimuthal dependence as 
well.

      In using the limb data, it should be noted that the angle of
view of the limb-viewing port relative to the sun is given by the
angle RAA in the data tables.  In addition, the precise elevation
angle which the beam makes with respect to the horizon is modified
by the mechanical reference position of the pointing prism inside
the instrument, the angle at which the instrument is installed in
the aircraft wing, and the roll angle of the plane in flight.  In
an equation:

              EL( ST ) = RA + REF + ST * IN + roll

         RA   - relative angle in aircraft e.g.: 3.4 degrees      
         REF  - reference angle relative to diffuser direction; 82.5 degrees
         ST   - step number recorded in data block
         IN   - step size of scanner = 1.5 degrees
         Roll - aircraft roll angle in data table

      A first approximation for correcting the horizontal diffuser
values is to assume that the horizon brightness does not change
with time after about 75 degrees SZA and that the mean of a number
of observations at various azimuth angles is representative of the
horizon.  A somewhat better estimate can be made by determining an
approximate variation of the brightness with azimuth angle.  This
estimate can then be used in the above equations to calculate the
contributions to the flux at altitude appropriate for a particular
application. Ultimately the best approach will to be to use a model
which has been verified in detail using flight data for the
determination of the appropriate flux value.

ASHOE Flights 1992, 1993
------------------------

      The CPFM experiment was flown on most of the ASHOE/MAESA flights.
Not all of the flights lead to useful data.  The following table
summarizes the dates on which the instrument might have flown, on which
it actually flew, those flights which have been analyzed and those for
which data have been included in this release.

      There are a number of reasons for not contributing fully
processed data at this time.  These include:

  1) the instrument did not fly on a flight because it was not
     scheduled to, or because it was not operating
  2) the gains on either the UV or visible spectral order were set 
     incorrectly
  3) the instrument failed in flight
  4) the on-board navigation data stream became unavailable during 
     flight (further work to assimilate the post-flight data is
     required; this applies mainly to the attitude information).
  5) a problem with the instrument, but it was flown anyway
  6) data recorder failure

General comments on the ASHOE/MAESA series data.
------------------------------------------

    Ozone data.

    The data analyzed for this release has not been calibrated against the
    Brewer observations made at Christchurch yet.  It is difficult to
    sort out which days' observations make good calibration sets.  The 
    TOMS data can always be used for comparison because the observing 
    conditions for the satellite and for the aircraft are less effected 
    by local weather conditions than the ground-based observations.
    Because there is no solar pointing on the aircraft, the total ozone
    column is determined by making a ratiometric measurement in the UV
    portion of the spectrum as observed by the horizontal diffuser. 
    This measurement will be very good at altitude where the direct
    solar intensity completely dominates other sources of light (such
    as the scattered sky light) but near the surface where the pressure
    is higher and especially when clouds are present, the results may
    be considerably in error.  As result, the calibration
    (extraterrestrial constant) for the ozone measurement was estimated
    by comparing results to TOMS measurements and making a reasonable
    choice of calibration constants.  The independent ground-based data 
    will be used to set the instrument extraterrestrial value for a later 
    data release.

Flight Specific Comments
------------------------

93/05/11

      This flight produced apparently good UV data for all fields except 
the horizontal flux.  Only UV data are available because the reference 
sensor for initializing the filter wheel motor failed.  As a temporary 
remedy, the filter was permanently set, a few minutes before 'hands
off' at the UV measuring position, and flew that way for the whole
flight.  The failure was corrected before the next flight.  However, it 
appears that the prism drive motor did not function completely 
correctly since the horizontal flux measurements are of a very much 
lower intensity than those made on other days under comparable 
conditions.  The ozone values were still computed, but the results have 
higher-than-usual noise level because of the low signal level.


FTP at the Atmospheric Environment Service
------------------------------------------

      The AES now has an FTP server available to the community.  It is on
a computer at the Downsview facility and will have a copy of the data
included here and available on CLOUD1.  In addition, the full spectral
data for ALL radiation fields, not just the horizontal flux, will be
available.  Other data can be made available in non-NASA formats on 
request.

      The file server is at address 199.212.19.42.  The account name is 
ER2 and the password can be obtained by calling the AES.  The full name 
of the server is: CMITS02.dow.on.doe.ca.
