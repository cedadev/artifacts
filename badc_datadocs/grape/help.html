<p><img src="true.gif" align="right" width="256" height="256">The importance of clouds to the radiation balance of the terrestrial climate
is well known. Accordingly, state-of-the-art climate models include
sophisticated parameterisations of the cloud variables. It has been known for
decades that climate simulations are very sensitive to changes in these
parameterisations.&nbsp; However, models can also introduce compensating errors,
that hide further sensitivities, for example, some GCMs differ by almost an
order of magnitude in their estimates of global ice water path while having
similar global top of the atmosphere (TOA) radiation budgets. It is also well
known that simulations aimed at predicting the climate in the presence of
increased CO<font size="-2">2</font> are also sensitive to the exact
specification of the cloud parameterisations. Accordingly, the community has put
an imperative on the validation of these schemes by confronting the model
simulations with observations.
<p>While high-resolution measurements obtained in experimental campaigns are
necessary to develop parameterisations, the evaluation of model cloudiness
requires comparison with global climatological data. Such climatological
comparisons can highlight specific areas of disagreement, but do not always
illuminate the reasons why the observations and models disagree as other model
problems can manifest themselves in the simulated cloudiness. To some extent
climate resolution simulations rely on parameterisation development and
validation carried out for Numerical&nbsp; Weather Prediction (NWP) --- process
studies at climate resolution are obviously much more difficult to carry out in
a meaningful way. For comparison with climate models, observational studies
restricted seasonally and/or spatially to identify specific synoptic regimes are
becoming more important.
<p><b>A new cloud climatology based on ATSR-2</b>
<p>GRAPE intends to produce a new cloud database which will include the
following parameters: Cloud Optical Depth Cloud Phase Cloud Particle Size Cloud
Top Pressure Cloud Fraction Cloud Water Path along with associated error
measurements (enabling the use of this data in some form of data assimilation at
a later date).
<p>The database&nbsp; will be based on retrievals carried out using all the
available ATSR-2 data (from 1995 to present), and will be produced using a
method developed for Meteosat Second Generation SEVIRI measurements and tested
on ATSR-2 data (hereafter, the RAL algorithm). The RAL algorithm is an
application of Optimal Estimation (OE) to the cloud retrieval problem: all
available measurements and all available a priori information are combined using
fast radiative transfer and known error characteristics to find the most
probable values of all cloud parameters simultaneously. The radiative transfer
includes cloud, atmosphere and surface effects and (currently) assumes a
plane-parallel single layer cloud (the 'model cloud').
<p>Application of OE is still a somewhat novel approach to cloud parameter
estimation. Traditional methods rely typically on sub-sets of measurements used
to independently derive&nbsp; sub-sets of parameters; for example, visible (VIS)
and near Infra-Red (NIR) measurements can be used to estimate visible optical
depth and drop size while an independent IR split window can be used to estimate
infrared optical depth and cloud temperature.
<p>The OE method presents several advantages:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It is theoretically sound, based on radiative transfer calculations and
    modelled errors in the input information.
  <li>It enables simultaneous use of all measurements, so that maximum
    information is extracted from the data set. (E.g. optical depth is normally
    best estimated from VIS channels as IR channels saturate very quickly, but
    in the extreme case of thin cloud over land the IR information becomes more
    useful than the VIS information which in compromised by the reflectance
    effects of the underlying surface. The OE method ``knows'' this and weights
    measurements appropriately.)
  <li>It can use a priori information easily and accounts correctly for errors
    in this information.
    </ul>
    <p><b>Why produce a new cloud climatology?</b></p>
    <p>Despite the apparent proliferation of cloud data, the information about
    cloud properties is often limited to frequency information and optical
    thickness along with environmental data (e.g. cloud top temperature and
    pressure). While there is relatively good agreement in some cases between
    sensors for gross measures of cloudiness (e.g. seasonal and zonal means)
    there is still considerable disagreement in detail.
    <p>ATSR-2 data are available from 1995 until the present day, and the ATSR-2
    instrument is exceptionally well calibrated. The RAL algorithm has been
    validated in studies for Eumetsat and will be made effective enough for the
    analysis of the entire ATSR-2 dataset under the auspices of the Cloudmap2
    project. The 6+years of data will provide a comparable length dataset to
    existing climatologies, and in conjunction with future data from the AATSR instrument (due to fly on ENVISAT), a very long duration dataset is
    possible. Analysis of current and future missions (e.g. MODISand MERIS) may
    eventually provide good cloud parameters, but they will not be able to
    measure in the 1990s!
    <p>One microphysical parameter of great interest to the global warming
    community is the effective radius, r<font size="-1">e</font>, of the
    droplets in clouds. r<font size="-1">e</font> can be derived from the cloud
    liquid water (CLW)&nbsp; itself a prognostic variable in modern
    parameterisations. The importance of r<font size="-1">e</font> is that it
    can be directly employed to couple the cloud parameterisation to the
    radiation, either via the cloud optical depth alone or by the cloud optical
    depth in conjunction with albedo and asymmetry parameters, all of which can
    be parameterised by a functional dependence on r<font size="-1">e</font>.
    Our retrieval method provides an estimate of r<font size="-1">e</font>
    (primarily based on the sensitivity of the 1.6 and 3.7 micrometre reflection
    to the size of the particles in the cloud), and this will be available
    wherever the retrieval is successful (i.e. near global coverage for the
    mission duration).
    <p>Particular points of scientific interest to be covered will be the
    interhemispheric difference in cirrus, and the quality of model predictions
    of cloud effective-radius in specific case studies. One of the major points
    of advantage of the ATSR-2 retrieval will be an accurate assessment of cloud
    phase, a notoriously difficult problem for model parameterizations. While
    high-resolution in-situ campaigns are the best way to derive such
    parameterisations, it is important that they are validated globally to
    ensure as much as possible their accuracy in a wide-range of synoptic
    settings.
    <p>A rigourous comparison with numerical simulations should eventually be
    carried out in the context of trying to understand particular experiments,
    or to understand the climate behaviour of some specific model versions.<br>
