The aims of the Data Protocol are:
<UL><br>
   <LI> to encourage rapid dissemination of scientific results from JET2000.
   <LI> to protect the rights of the individual scientists funded by JET2000.
   <LI> to have all the involved researchers treated equitably.
   <LI> to ensure the quality of the data in the JET2000 data archive.
</UL>
<P>
<OL>
  <LI> Observational data must be made available to other JET2000 scientists
     as soon as possible. These data will then be made available to the
     public domain by 1 January 2001.
  <LI> Any corrections or amendments to the observational data should be
     announced as soon as possible.
  <LI> Validated data must be made available to other JET2000 scientists
     via the BADC within 6 months of creation. The data will then be made
     available to the public domain 18 months after its submission to the
     BADC.
  <LI> Results of model studies using data acquired during JET2000 must be
     made available to other JET2000 scientists via the BADC. The time
     scale for submission is the same as that for validated data, as
     outlined in point 3.
  <LI> Data submitted to the BADC must be in the data format agreed between
     JET2000 PIs and the BADC. All agreed metadata describing the data
     must also be supplied.
  <LI> It is each PI's responsibility to ensure that the data used in
     publications are the best available at that time.
  <LI> All investigators and collaborators involved in JET2000 are to have
     equal and complete access to measurements and model results produced
     during JET2000.
  <LI> If measurements or model results from research groups within JET2000
     are used in a publication, acknowledgement of NERC and the UK Met Office
     Meteorological Research Flight must be made.
  <LI> Whilst the data is restricted from the public domain (see point 3),
     each PI has the right to refuse to allow his/her work, whether
     measurement or calculation, to be used in a publication or presentation
     prior to the PI's own publication of that work.
 <LI> Whilst the data is restricted from the public domain (see point 3), no
     data should be transferred to a third party without the originator's
     consent.
 <LI> In the event of dispute the final decision rests with the JET2000 
     PI's.
