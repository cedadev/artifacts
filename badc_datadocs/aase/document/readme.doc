README.DOC  (1990-03-13)

1. Introduction

This CDROM contains data pertaining to the Airborne Arctic Stratospheric
Expedition (AASE) which was based in Stavanger, Norway during January and
February, 1989.

The data consists of measurements collected onboard the NASA ER-2 and DC-8 
aircraft, ozonesonde soundings from three stations (Angmagssalik and 
Scoresbysund, Greenland, and Lerwick, U.K.), aerosol and temperature profiles
from the SAM II satellite, global grid point values of Nimbus 7 TOMS ozone, 
and selected radiosonde soundings from stations in the region of the 
experiment.

Theory teams provided calculations of: potential vorticity along the ER-2 
flight path; cross-sections of potential vorticity, temperature, and 
geopotential heights along the DC-8 flight path; cross-sections of Clx, Fx, HCl,
HNO3, and NOy along the DC-8 flight path; global grid point values of 
temperature, geopotential heights, and horizontal winds on selected pressure
surfaces; northern hemispheric grid point values of potential vorticity and
pressure on selected potential temperature surfaces.

And to whet the appetite of those seeking turbulence, two files of 5 Hz data
from the ER-2 Meteorological Measurement System (MMS) have been included for 
flights during which mesoscale disturbances were observed.  A separate
CDROM containing all of the 5 Hz MMS data during the 1989 AASE (including
the two files on this CDROM) is available as an appendix to this CDROM
volume.

All files within this release are standard ASCII files with variable length 
records terminated by <CR><LF> (ASCII decimal values 13 and 10).  In general, 
the file naming convention uses a two character prefix to identify the 
measurement, followed by a six digit number giving the year, month, and day 
(GMT) of the flight (or balloon launch).  To identify the measurement platform,
a three character extension of ER2, DC8, or Bhh is used to denote the data is 
from the ER-2, DC-8, or balloon (hh denotes the GMT hour of launch).  
Exceptions to this convention are the data files for the DC-8 Mark IV 
interferometer (M489AASE.DC8) and the SAM II measurements (SAM2ARSL.DAT, 
SAM2TEMP.DAT) which contain all available data within a single file.  The 
names of the files containing hemispheric and global grid point analyses are 
also exceptions in that the extensions are used to denote the potential 
temperature or pressure surface values of the analyses, and the TOMS data 
files have the extension of .DAT.

2. Directories

2.1  The DOCUMENT directory contains several files documenting the contents of
this release.

2.1.1  CATALOG.DOC contains tables showing the available aircraft data and 
appropriate file name prefixes, the locations of the radiosonde stations, and
brief descriptions of the available data.

2.1.2  CONTACT.DOC contains a list of names, addresses, and phone numbers of
the principal investigators.

2.1.3  FORMAT.DOC gives the format specifications which all experimenters were
encouraged to use when writing time series data files for data exchange.  The 
standard format includes header information which describes the data, and the 
data in the form of time series.  Some of the measurements (ie. balloon and
lidar soundings, and those with nonuniform sampling intervals), and the grid
data, are not easily cast as time series with constant sampling intervals so 
some of the data files have unique formats.  But most of the ER-2 data files 
and many of the DC-8 files follow this standard format (with the exception 
that we have changed the file name extensions from A1 to ER2 or DC8).  This 
document may serve as a guide for reading the data files.

2.2  The DATA directory has eight subdirectories for the ER-2, DC-8, SAM II,
TOMS, 3-D analyses, 5 Hz MMS, ozonesonde, and radiosonde data files.  

2.2.1 The ER2 subdirectory contains the available data collected onboard the
ER-2 aircraft, and calculations of potential vorticity along the ER-2 flight
path.  Each file contains data for one flight so the data is organized
by flight date.

2.2.2 The DC8 subdirectory contains the available data collected onboard the
DC-8 aircraft, and calculated vertical cross-sections of potential vorticity,
temperature, geopotential height, Clx, Fx, HCl, HNO3, and NOy along the DC-8
flight path.  In general, each file contains data for only one flight so the
data is organized by flight date.  However, the file for the Mark IV
Interferometer contains data for several flights in a single file.  This 
exception has been placed in the DC8MISC subdirectory.  

2.2.3 The SAM2 subdirectory contains the aerosol and temperature data from the
SAM II satellite measurements.  All available aerosol extinction data and
temperature data each occupy a single file.

2.2.4 The TOMS subdirectory contains the total ozone data files from the 
Nimbus 7 Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) - one file per day.

2.2.5 The O3SONDE subdirectory contains the ozonesonde data organized by launch
site with one file for each ozonesonde sounding.

2.2.6 The RAOB subdirectory contains the radiosonde sounding data collected in
Stavanger, Norway during the deployment.  Each file contains all available
soundings for a particular time period.

2.2.7 The ANALYSES subdirectory contains 12 Z analyses of meteorological
parameters organized by the type of surface on which the analyses were done
(isentropic and isobaric).

2.2.8 The MMS5HZ subdirectory contains two files of 5 Hz ER-2 MMS data.
