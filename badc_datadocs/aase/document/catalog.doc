1. The following table indicates the ER-2 files which are contained in this 
release and the two character file prefix for each type of file (BR for BrO, 
NO for NOy, etc.).

    X = dataset is contained in this release
blank = dataset not available for release

        (No distinction is made as to why a particular dataset is not
         available. Some blanks are a result of a temporary instrument
         failure. In other cases there may be data available for a given 
         flight, but for whatever reason the PI could not assure its 
         reliability and therefore did not include it in this 
         release. The user is encouraged to contact the PI directly, if a 
         particular data file they desire is missing - see CONTACT.DOC for 
         names and addresses).

1.1 Notes:
There is a separate subdirectory for each flight which contains all files for 
that particular flight.  If pp represents an arbitrary filename prefix then 
the file naming convention is ppyymmdd.ER2, where yy=last two digits of the 
year number, mm=month number, dd=day of month number.

Ferry flight NOy data is available but requires additional processing.  
Contact D.Fahey for details.

2.2 Notes:
There is a separate subdirectory for each flight which contains all files for 
that particular flight.  The file naming convention is ppyymmdd.DC8.
One exception to this rule is the file named M489AASE.DC8 which is in the 
DC8MISC subdirectory and contains all of the Mark IV interferometer data.

The scale factors in the file headers are intended to be numbers by which to
multiply the recorded values to obtain the units specified in the file header.
The CX, FX, HC, HF, HN, HU, NC, and NU files give scale factors of 1.0E-12 
while stating 'units' of parts per trillion by volume (pptv).  The recorded
numbers in these files are actually ALREADY in pptv, indicating a correct
scale factor of 1.0; multiplying by the given scale factor of 1.0E-12 yields
a true, unscaled mixing ratio (the value used in numerical calculations 
involving these quantities).

Note on the NX data files:
Nitric oxide (NO) measurements were obtained over a 10 second averaging period.
The ambient mixing ratios were determined by subtracting the instrument
background signal from the measurement signal and accounting for instrument
artifact as determined from measurements obtained during periods of darkness
(where ambient NO is expected to be zero).  All numbers thus obtained are
reported, including negative values (although negative values are not
representative of real mixing ratios, they demonstrate the scatter in the 10
second data).  Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) ambient mixing ratios were determined by
subtracting the NO measure signal from the NO2 measure signal and accounting
for instrument artifact as determined from tests conducted with zero air.  For
the measurement of NO2, the photolysis cell was maintained at 0 C.  NO2+ mixing
ratios were determined in the same manner as were the NO2 mixing ratios except
that the photolysis cell was heated to 40 C, and the artifact for this mode
was not determined.

Note on the NY data files:
NOy was measured alternately through a forward and a backward facing inlet
(NOy(2), NOy(1), two minutes each mode).  The backward facing inlet 
discriminates against larger particles (>0.5 micrometers) thus sampling mainly
gas phase NOy.  The forward facing inlet oversamples large particles due to the
much higher linear speed of the aircraft verses the inlet flow velocity.  The
amount of any enhancement depends on the particle size distribution.  That
information is not available for the AASE measurements.  Hence any increase in
NOy-`forward' over NOy-`backward' can only be interpreted as a qualitative 
measure of the presence of NOy on particles.  Some NOy-`forward' data were
omitted due to contamination of the forward inlet, presumably by cloud water, on
a few ascents out of Sola airfield.  This contamination of the NOy converter 
led to reduced detection efficiencies (~80%) for HNO3 and an underestimation of
NOy.


3. Vertical profiles of aerosol extinction coefficients and temperatures from
SAM II satellite measurements are presented for the time period 89-01-01 to
89-02-18.  All aerosol data is contained in one file (SAM2ARSL.DAT), and all
temperature data is contained in SAM2TEMP.DAT.


4. Global grid point values of TOMS total ozone measurements (Version 5) are 
available for December 1988, and January and February 1989.  There is one file
per day with filenames TOyymmdd.DAT.


5. Ozonesonde soundings from Angmagssalik and Scoresbysund Greenland, and 
Lerwick, U.K. are available for most of the duration of the experiment.  On the
average, each station launched an ozonesonde every other day.  There is a
separate subdirectory for each launch site.  The file naming convention is 
AMyymmdd.Bhh (Angmagssalik), LWyymmdd.Bhh (Lerwick), and SByymmdd.Bhh 
(Scoresbysund), where hh=GMT hour of launch.  

A.Torres has cautioned us that the Lerwick tracking antenna had problems at 
low elevation angles, so after about t+30 minutes the winds in the Lerwick 
soundings should be used with caution.


6. The following table indicates the positions of the radiosonde stations for
which we received sounding data during the deployment in Stavanger.  Three of
the locations (Angmagssalik, Scoresbysund, and Lerwick) were also ozonesonde
launch sites.  All soundings are in one subdirectory.  The file naming 
convention is RSyymmdd.Bhh.  Each file contains all available soundings for a 
particular time interval (+- 2 hours from the hour hh).

We received the radiosonde soundings (RAOB's) from the Norwegian Meteorological
Institute (DNMI) in Oslo in the WMO coded format.  A complete sounding comes 
in four separate transmissions (parts A, B, C, and D) and, unfortunately, many 
of the soundings are incomplete.  However, having the coded soundings allowed
us to remove any obvious coding errors.

7. Two sets of 12 Z meteorological analyses are presented: one is analyses of 
potential vorticity and pressure on constant potential temperature surfaces;
the other is analyses of temperature, geopotential height, and horizontal wind
components on constant pressure surfaces.

All isentropic analyses are in one subdirectory.  The file naming convention is
PVyymmdd.ttt (potential vorticity) and PRyymmdd.ttt (pressure), where
ttt=potential temperature surface value.  The isentropic analyses cover the 
time period 88-12-29 to 89-02-21, and are derived from NMC analyses.

All isobaric analyses are in one subdirectory.  The data is generated using
the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) STRATAN data assimilation scheme to 
improve upon an initial, first guess field.  The file naming convention is 
AAyymmdd.ppp and AFyymmdd.ppp, where AA or AF indicate the type of first 
guess field and ppp=pressure surface value.  AA indicates that NMC ANALYSES 
were used as the first guess fields, while AF indicates that NMC FORECAST 
fields were used as the first guess. The isobaric analyses cover the time 
period 89-01-01 to 89-02-24.


8. Two files containing 5 Hz ER-2 MMS data are also included.  The files are in
a separate subdirectory and have the names MM890130.ER2 and MM890210.ER2.  The
dates were selected because there were observed mesoscale disturbances on those
days, thus providing good test cases for applying the 5 Hz data to their 
analysis.  These are LARGE files (greater than 20 Mb each); there are more 
variables recorded per flight than in the 1 Hz MMS data, and unlike the 1 Hz 
data, all of the variables are contained in a single file.  As indicated in 
the README.DOC file, these two files along with the remaining 5 Hz MMS data 
files for the 1989 AASE flights are contained on a separate, companion CDROM 
(which contains only the 5 Hz MMS data).  Contact Steve Hipskind or Steve
Gaines (see README.DOC for addresses and phone numbers) for details on this 
companion disc.
