<h3><a href="http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/browse/badc/ukmo-hadsst2/data/HadSST2_SST_1850_onwards">HadSST2_SST_1850_onwards</a>: Monthly 5degree resolution SST anomalies wrt 1961-90 climatology</h3>

<p>The observations that make up this dataset are taken from the International 
Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere DataSet, ICOADS (see http://www.cdc.noaa.gov/coads/), 
until 1997 and from the NCEP GTS  archive thereafter. Individual observations must 
first pass a series of quality checks (track check, reality check, positional check, 
climatology check, buddy check, duplicate check). The quality-checked observations 
in each  1degree longitude X 1degree latitude X pentad gridbox are then averaged 
using a winsorised average. The pentad climatology is then subtracted from these 
pentad superobs and the resulting anomalies are averaged to 5degree X 5degree X 
monthly resolution. The data are then bias-corrected for the use of buckets in the 
period 1850-1941.

<p>Measurement and sampling error refers to the random error caused by estimating an 
area-averaged quantity from a finite number of noisy observations. These errors are 
calculated directly from the gridded data. Measurement and sampling errors are 
uncorrelated between gridboxes.

<p>The bias bound represents the low (2.5 percent) error bound on the bias corrected 
data as calculated from 1000 physically plausible realisations of the bias corrected 
dataset. The bias errors are completely correlated between gridboxes.
</p>

<h3><a href="http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/browse/badc/ukmo-hadsst2/data/HadSST2_97.5_pct_bias_1850on.txt">HadSST2_97.5_pct_bias_1850on.txt</a>: 97.5 percent bias bound, equivalent to 2 standard errors</h3>

<p>The bias bound represents the high (97.5 percent) error bound on the bias corrected 
data as calculated from 1000 physically plausible realisations of the bias corrected 
dataset. The bias errors are completely correlated between gridboxes.
</p>

<h3>A note on combining errors</h3>

<blockquote>If you would like to create combined 2 sigma uncertainties at each gridbox, it is 
suggested that you subtract the "low_bias" field from the "high_bias"field, divide 
by two and then add to two times the sampling and measurement errors in quadrature, 
as they are independent uncertainties. This is because the bias uncertainties are 
95% confidence intervals, but the sampling and measurement errors are 1 standard error. 
Note that, although the sampling and measurement errors are uncorrelated between grid 
boxes, the bias correction uncertainties are completely correlated between grid boxes. 
This will have implications for the way youcalculate average uncertainties for any 
averaged time series that you create, e.g. your Nino3.4 index.</blockquote>
