Introduction
</h2>

The <i>Reading Assimilated Atmospheric Satellite Data</i> include
three-dimensional fields of temperature, ozone and water vapour obtained by
assimilation of satellite observations (UARS MLS, GOME, possibly other
satellite data) and a variety of operational observations into the HADAM3
version of the troposphere-stratosphere general circulation Unified Model (UM).
This data set is currently being produced as part of the <i>Assimilation of
Research Satellite Data Using a General Circulation Model of the Troposphere
and Stratosphere</i> project, under the <a href="../"><i>Assimilation of
Remote-sensed Data for Applications in the Atmospheric and Oceanographic
Sciences (ARDAAOS)</i></a> NERC thematic programme.
Several versions of this data set will be produced, corresponding to successive
versions of the assimilation scheme and newly available observational data sets.
