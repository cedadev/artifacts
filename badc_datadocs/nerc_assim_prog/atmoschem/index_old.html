Introduction</H2>

<p>
The <i>Cambridge Chemical Assimilation Data</i> were produced in the framework
of the <i>Enhanced atmospheric constituents data assimilation</i> project
(PI: David Lary) under the <i><a href="../">Assimilation of Remote-sensed
Data for Applications in the Atmospheric and Oceanographic Sciences
(ARDAAOS)</a></i> NERC thematic programme.
</p>
<P>
The ever-increasing quantity and availability of observational
data allows us to develop more accurate and more detailed atmospheric
models than ever before. Unfortunately there is a drawback to
having this amount of readily accessible information, namely the
time that must necessarily be invested in sorting and extracting
the required data. Given that different datasets are invariably
presented in different file formats this process is usually performed
from scratch each time, especially when data from more than one
set is required. This data is designed to combat this problem
by using: 
<p>
<UL>
  <LI>A common file format
  <LI>Flexible database import &amp; export
  <LI>Rapid searching of large datasets
</UL>

Access to Data - File Format</H2>

<P>To gain access to this dataset, please 
<A HREF="/cgi-bin/dataset_registration/dataset_info.cgi.pl?datasetid=cambchem">apply for access to the 
Cambridge Chemical Assimilation data</a>. The application 
 includes the Met Office Agreement to completed online - you will receive email confirmation when access has been granted.


<P>The file format is a column-based plain text file with one
file for each day of observations from each instrument. The data
usually consist of the date, time and location of the measurement
along with the measurement itself and an estimate of the error
on that value. In addition to these we add several other quantities
describing the atmosphere at that location and time. The full list
is given in the table below. Those quantities marked with an asterisk (*)
are used as co-ordinates and may be used to specify limits in
the search process.<P>
