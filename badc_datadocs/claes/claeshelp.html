<P>This section contains a brief, simplified outline of the CLAES
instrument and the measurement techniques which are employed. Users
requiring a more detailed description of the design and operation
of the instrument should consult the paper by <A HREF="references.html">Roche
et al. (1993).</A>

  <H4>1.1 <A NAME="description"></A>Instrument Description</H4>
  <P>CLAES is a cryogenically cooled infrared spectrometer which measures thermal emission from the Earth's limb. Characteristic
  vibration-rotation spectral line radiances are obtained between
  3.5 and 13 microns and these are then fed into retrieval algorithms
  to obtain pressures, temperatures and species mixing ratios.
  <P>The instrument observes the Earth's limb in a direction normal
  to the orbital track on the anti-sun side of the spacecraft.The
  tangent point is a great circle distance of approximately 
23&deg; (2500km) away from the sub-satellite track, and is swept
  horizontally along the limb by the motion of the spacecraft. The
  field of view of the instrument is centred on a point at approximately
  35km altitude at the limb tangent point. The optical design allows
  observations to be performed over an altitude range of 10 to
  60 km with a spacing of 2.5km.
  <P>The instrument observes radiation through a 6-inch aperture
  Mersene telescope. The altitude range of the observations is
  adjusted by means of a motorised limb acquisition and adjustment
  mirror (LAAM). The CLAES spectrometer consists of one of four
  tilt-scanned Fabry-Perot etalons which are used in conjunction
  with one or more of nine interference filters which define the
  spectral channels. Radiation emerging from the spectrometer is
  focussed onto the focal plane assembly (FPA) consisting of two
  linear arrays of SiGa detectors. The main array has 20 elements
  and provides 2.5 km spacing at the limb. A separate three-element
  array is used with the 3.5 mm HCL channel, which sacrifices vertical
  resolution to increase signal-to-noise for the weak atmospheric
  thermal emissions at this short wavelength.
  <P>CLAES carries a full aperture black body calibration source
  on the inside of the telescope aperture door, which is passively
  heated by radiation from the Earth when the door is open during
  data acquisition. When the door is closed the black body slowly
  cools allowing an end-to-end absolute radiometric calibration
  over a large part of the instrument's dynamic range. 
<P>The Cryogens which slowly evaporated as they cooled the instrument, were designed to last about 18
months in orbit, allowing CLAES to make scientific measurements from 1st October 1991 through 5th May
1993, when the cryogens finally evaporated and the instrument warmed up.

  <H4>1.2 <A NAME="techniques"></A>Measurement Techniques</H4>
  <P>Spectroscopy of the incoming radiation is performed by tilt-scanning
  one of the four Fabry-Perot etalons between 0 and 23&deg;
  in conjunction with blocking filters to define the spectral channel.
  The spectrometer can operate in one of two modes :
  <P><ul><li><STRONG>Spectral Survey Mode </STRONG>in which each of the
  nine spectral intervals is spectrally scanned in 0.02 cm<sup>-1</sup> steps
  over the etalon's free spectral range. Each scan takes 65.5 seconds
  making a total of 590 seconds for all channels.
  <p><li><STRONG>Primary Science Mode </STRONG>this is the usual CLAES
  operating mode, in which all parameters required to retrieve
  geophysical parameters must be acquired in a single 65.5 second
  period - the time taken for the spacecraft to move 500 km along
  track. This is achieved by targetting a limited number of spectral
  positions in each of the nine intervals. <BR>
</ul><BR>
<BR>
  
  <H4>1.3 <A NAME="process"></A>Data Processing Techniques</H4>
  <P>The UARS data processing is carried out at the <A HREF="http://www-uars.gsfc.nasa.gov/"
  TARGET="_top">Central Data Handling Facility</A> at the Goddard
  Space Flight Center using software supplied by the instrument's
  Principal Investigator group. The data processing for UARS instruments
  consists of a progression through a sequence of `levels' from
  the raw telemetry at level 0 to geophysical quantities interpolated
  onto standard grids at level 3. The processing steps for CLAES
  are outlined below : <p>
  <ul>
<li><STRONG>Level 1 processing</STRONG>: In the first processing
  step, the level 0 data (the raw telemetry) is processed to remove
  instrument-specific effects and a set of calibrated data is derived
  in physical units (eg. voltages and radiances) tagged with their
  locations which are written to a level 1 product.
  <P><li><STRONG>Level 2 processing </STRONG>: The level 1 data are
  then processed further to produce the level 2 product which contains
  vertical profiles of temperature, pressure and mixing ratios
  of chemical constituents at the measurement positions. This step
  involves a complex retrieval algorithm which consists of two
  principal stages : In the first step the pressure and temperature
  are retrieved as a function of the instrument's altitude grid,
  using features of the CO<sub>2</sub> spectrum in the spectral channel at
  789-793 cm<sup>-1</sup>. This region also contains a significant contribution
  from ozone, which must be retrieved simultaneously. The temperatures
  and pressures are then fed into the retrievals of mixing ratios
  from the radiances measured in other spectral channels. The algorithm
  used in the routine retrievals of geophysical parameters from
  CLAES data is an optimal mix of two different processes, one
  involving a relaxation technique to obtain a simultaneous retrieval
  over the whole altitude range and the second using an onion-peeling
  process. Both algorithms use some a priori information. For more
  details refer to <A HREF="references.html">Roche et al.(1993).</A>
  <P><li><STRONG>Level 3A processing </STRONG>: The level 2 data are
  profiles located at the measurement positions which are determined
  by the scan pattern and by the track of the tangent point. The
  level 2-3A processing step takes these data and interpolates
  them onto a standard set of vertical levels, evenly spaced
  in log pressure, and onto standard times (level 3AT) and standard
  latitudes (level 3AL).</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>2. <A NAME="data"></A><U>The Data</U></H3>

<P>The public <a href="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/claesl3//data">CLAES data</a> held at the BADC is at level 3A version
 8.  Some files from earlier processing version (v0007) are also held where there are gaps in the version 8 data. 
The version number refers to the processing algorithm which
is used to create the level 3A files.

<P>The data is stored in UARS binary format. Software
is available to convert the files into ASCII data.

<BR>
<BR>
  <STRONG>Horizontal Coverage:</STRONG> <BR>
  Views of the limb from the UARS orbit extend to 10&deg; of
  the pole. To achieve maximum latitude coverage, the instrument
  views at right angles to the orbit track. The spacecraft performs
  a 180&deg;
 yaw approximately every 36 days so that the spacecraft
  orientation relative to the velocity vector is reversed. (eg.
  the spacecraft flies &quot;backwards&quot; rather than &quot;forwards&quot;).
  <P>Each spacecraft yaw manoeuvre changes the coverage from high
  latitudes in one hemisphere to high latitudes in the other. Thus,
  when the spacecraft files &quot;forwards&quot;, the coverage
  is 80&deg;S to 34&deg;N, and when it flies &quot;backwards&quot;
  the coverage is 80&deg;N to 34&deg;S.
  <P>The latitudinal coverage of the CLAES instrument is compared
  with the other UARS instruments in <A HREF="/data/uars/figures/uars_lat_coverage.html">UARS Figure
