<h2><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h2>
<P>
In order to help the automatic cataloguing of data files, to ensure the
consistency of the data archive, and to extend the usability of the data 
archive
it is important to adopt certain metadata
standards.  This means that names of institutes, names of compounds, time labels
etc. are applied consistently both within files of similar type and across
the data archive as a whole.  By adopting the NASA-Ames
format for Data Exchange as the format for field observation data certain
metadata standards are imposed on UTLS-OZONE.  On top of these imposed standards other
standards can be chosen.  For instance in ACSOE the use of KEYWORDS introduced
consistent metadata into the files.  This document makes explicit the
metadata standards that are part of the NASA-Ames file format and suggests other
standards that could be adopted for UTLS-OZONE.</p>

<p>This document is separate to the description of the file format: the meta data
standards can be applied to file formats other than NASA Ames.  This document
has been written with NASA Ames Format for Data Exchange in mind however, and so
makes most sense if the reader is already familiar with the NASA Ames
format.  A short introduction to the NASA Ames format can be found
<a href="./NASAAmes.html">here.</a></p>  

<h2><a name="nasa">Metadata from the NASA-Ames Format for Data Exchange</a></h2>
<p>The definition of the NASA-Ames Format, and in particular the header,
automatically defines some of the metadata content, and in some cases the
metadata format.  The table outlines the content, and where defined, the format
for metadata that is part of the NASA-Ames format Standard.</p>
<table border>
<tr><th>Metadata</th><th>NASA-Ames imposed Format</th><th>UTLS-OZONE
Format</th><th>Example</th></tr>
<tr><td>Originator of file</td><td>Surname, Other names.  One line less than 132
characters</td><td>Surname, Initials</td><td><kbd>Bloggs, J.</kbd></td></tr>
<tr><td>Originators Address</td><td>One line less than 132
characters</td><td><a href="./address.html">Agreed Postal Address</a></td> <td> </td></tr>
<tr><td>Source Name</td><td>One line less than 132 characters</td><td>Platform /
Instrument</td><td><kbd>c-130 / UV meter</kbd></td></tr>
<tr><td>Mission Name</td><td>One line less than 132 characters</td><td>Project /
<kbd>UTLS-OZONE</kbd></td><td><kbd>ACTO / UTLS-OZONE</kbd></td></tr>
<tr><td>Start date of
observations</td><td>yyyy mm dd</td><td>yyyy mm dd</td><td><kbd>1999 01 01</kbd></td></tr>
<tr><td>Date of data
reduction</td><td>yyyy mm dd</td><td>yyyy mm dd</td><td><kbd>1999 01 01</kbd></td></tr>
<tr><td>Variable Names</td><td> </td><td>Name (units)</td><td><kbd>UV Flux
(W/m2)</kbd></td></tr>
<tr><td>Missing values</td><td>Larger than any good value</td><td>Larger than
any good value</td><td><kbd>999.999</kbd></td></tr>
</table>

<P>There are no conventions placed on variable names by the standard.  For
UTLS-OZONE it is suggested that an agreed set of variable names will be used, to
ensure consistency across data files, and in particular files from different
instruments which measure the same quantity.

<h2><a name="times">Time stamps</a></h2>
<p>Many of the instruments have time as the independent variable.  Where
possible it is suggested that this time is measured in seconds from 0UTC on the
start date and labelled <kbd>Seconds from 0UTC on start date</kbd>.  Other time
units may be used if necessary, but please check with the BADC to get a name
that is consistent with usage across the archive.</p>

<p>Where data has been averaged or collected over a time interval then the
centre of the averaging or collection time should be given in the file.  If this
is not possible then this should be made clear in the normal comments section of
the file.</p>

<h2><a name="errors">Error Flags</a></h2>
It is suggested that all observational data submitted to the archive should have
an indication of the uncertainty limits of the individual observations.  Where
possible a quantitative error (absolute or relative) should be given.  Failing
this use the qualitative error flags that have been adopted by the MRF and used
during ACSOE.<P>

<table border>
<tr><th>Flag</th><th>Meaning</th><tr>
<tr><td>0</td><td>Valid</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>Reduced quality</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Present, but likely to be wrong or instrument not in
measurement mode</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Completely invalid or missing data</td></tr>
</table>


<p>It is suggested that a description of these flags be included as part of the
normal comments in the NASA-Ames file.  The description can be expanded upon 
where necessary, for instance, give the reason for thinking the data is of
reduced quality, or the algorithm by which the quality of the data has been
determined.

<h2><a name="keywords">Keywords used for data management</a></h2>
In previous campaigns, such as ACSOE, keywords have been included as part of the
comments in the file header.  For UTLS-OZONE there are two compulsory
keywords: the e-mail address of the originator and the file version.
Other keywords are optional.  Keywords 
can easily lead to inconsistencies in the dataset if not used correctly and
so it is better to omit the optional keywords if you cannot guarantee their
correct use. 
The keywords should be included in the normal comments section of the file.<p>

<table border>
<tr><th>Keyword</th><th>example</th><th>Use</th></tr>
<tr><td>E-MAIL-CONTACT</td><td>j.bloggs@rl.ac.uk</td><td>compulsary</td></tr>
<tr><td>THIS-FILE-NAME</td><td></td><td>optional (omit)</td></tr>
<tr><td>THIS-FILE-VERSION</td><td>1</td><td>compulsary</td></tr>
<tr><td>THIS-FILE-ENDS</td><td>1999 01 02</td><td>use if different from start
date</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
At some time the BADC may take over the implementation of version number recording 
and updating.  Until they do you should try and keep track of your own version
numbers.

<h2><a name="other">Other Information</a></h2>
Other information can be given in the normal comments section of the file.  The
normal comments section can be used to clarify the instrument type or version,
its operation mode, retrieval algorithms and the nature of any averaging that has
been done.  Normal comments need not be verbose, but can used to supply
information that will greatly enhance the integrity and usability of the data
set.  The following list is suggested for possible inclusion in the normal
comments section of the file: <P>
<ul>
<li>Flight Number (if appropriate)
<li>instrument description
  <ul>
  <li>Make, model and id for commercial instruments
  <li>Reference to paper describing instrument operation and characteristics for
 in-house instruments
  </ul>
<li>Retrieval algorithm description and version (with references)
<li>Description of any averaging that has been performed (with references)
</ul>

<P>The extra information can be included in a keyword like way, for instance
using the keyword FLIGHT-NUMBER, but there are no plans as yet to use these
for cataloguing the data and so their format is much less constrained.

<h2><a name="special">Special Comments</a></h2>
NASA-Ames format for data exchange provides a section for special comments. 
These can be used to describe any special problems or circumstances associated
with the data.  If the file is resubmitted to the archive then the special
comments should outline any changes from the previous version.
