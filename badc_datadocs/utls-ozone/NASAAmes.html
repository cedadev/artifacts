<h1>NASA-Ames format for data exchange</h1>
<HR ALIGN=LEFT>
<p>UTLS-OZONE has adopted NASA-Ames Format for Data Exchange as the file format for
field observation data.  NASA-Ames format is a text based format, that is self
describing and portable, but at the same time flexible.  The definition of the
format is given in the document 
<a href="./forspec.txt">Format Specification for Data Exchange</a> by
Gaines and Hipskind.  This document is intended as a short introduction to the
NASA-Ames format for use by the UTLS-OZONE thematic program.</p>

<h2><a name="intro">Introduction<a></h2>
<p>The NASA Ames Format for Data Exchange, often referred to as simply NASA Ames
format, grew out of NASA Aircraft campaigns.  The format was developed taking
into account the following considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The files should be portable across all platforms.  This means that a text
based format has been chosen.  This has the added advantage of being human
readable.
<li>The file should be self describing.  This means that the files contain all
the information needed to describe the file contents.
<li>By adopting a standard file format the amount of software needed to analyse
and display different data sets should be minimised.
</ul>

<p>Each NASA Ames file is made up of the first line which contains information
on the file type, a file header section, and a data
section.  The file header contains the information needed to make the file
self describing, as well as giving information such as the origin of the data. 
Once the form of a file for a particular instrument has been decided on the file
header for that instrument has only a few changes from file to file.  
More information is given in on the
file header in the section <a href="#header">The file header</a>.  
The data section lists the data, in a
column oriented format.  More information on the data section is given in the
section <a href="#data">The Data Section</a>.
</p>

<h2><a name="File names">File names</a></h2>
The requirement that NASA Ames files are portable puts some constraints on the
File names since some operating systems, e.g. DOS, limit the length of allowed
File names.  The agreed convention for NASA Ames files is
<kbd>ppyymmdd.ext</kbd>, where <kbd>pp</kbd> is a two letter prefix,
<kbd>yymmdd</kbd> is a date, and <kbd>ext</kbd> is an extension.  The prefix and
extension can be used to identify site, platform, instrument and constituent. 
The way in which the prefix and extensions are used is left to the individual
experimental campaigns, and is not specified as part of the NASA Ames standard.

<h2><a name="variables">Variables</a></h2>
<p>The observed data can be represented in NASA Ames files as numeric or
character data.  Clearly the most commonly used is numeric data, though
character data can be used for site names etc.  The allowed characters in
numeric fields are 0-9, +, -, ., and E.  The character data can use any
printable ASCII character (ASCII codes 32 to 126).</p>

<p>NASA Ames uses three kinds of variables: INDEPENDENT, PRIMARY and
AUXILIARY.  The INDEPENDENT variable(s) are used to define the dimensions of the
data, and so must be <em>monotonic</em>.  There may be more than one primary variable,
and so NASA Ames format can accommodate multi-dimensional data.  For most
UTLS-OZONE field campaign data, however there will be only one 
INDEPENDENT variable in
the file, and for most of the files this will be time.  For each NASA Ames files
there can be one, and only one, unbounded INDEPENDENT variable.</p>

<p>PRIMARY variables are the main variables that are in the file: they are the
quantities that have been observed or derived e.g. temperature, winds, ozone.
There can be more than one
PRIMARY variable in each NASA Ames file.  This allows for the inclusion of more
than one observed field in each file.  The PRIMARY variables are considered
as functions of the INDEPENDENT variables.</p>

<p>The AUXILIARY variables are used for ancillary information about the
observations.  They may, for instance, be used to represent additional dimension
information: the INDEPENDENT variable is time but AUXILIARY variables are used
to represent geographical position and height.  For most files produced as part
of UTLS-OZONE there will be no AUXILIARY variables.</p>

<p>The PRIMARY and AUXILIARY variables have scale factors and missing value
flags associated with them.  The scale factor can, of course, be 1.0.  The
missing value should be larger than any good data value within the file.  The
scale factors and missing values are defined in the File Header.</p>
 
<h2><a name="ffi">File Format Index</a></h2>
The first line of every NASA Ames file records the length of the file header
(including the first line) and
a File Format Index.  The File Format Index identifies the type of
NASA Ames file: it specifies the number of INDEPENDENT variables (dimensions),
the increment of the INDEPENDENT variables, the nature (numeric or character) of
the variables, and whether there are AUXILIARY
variables present.  The File Format Index is a four digit integer, the most
significant digit gives the number of INDEPENDENT variables in the file.  For
most UTLS-OZONE files the File Format Index is <kbd>1001</kbd>.  This File
Format Index defines files with one unbounded real independent variable with
real primary variables and no AUXILIARY variables.  If other File
Format Indices are needed, please contact the <a href="/help/contact.html">BADC</a>.

<h2><a name="header">The file header</a></h2>
The file header contains the information which defines the contents of the file.
It consists of several pieces of information or subsections.  The details of the
file header are determined by the File Format Index.  But all file headers
contain the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data Originator: name, institute, instrument, campaign
<li>Storage information (largely obsolete with todays storage media)
<li>Date of the measurements and date of data reduction
<li>Description of the INDEPENDENT variables
<li>Description of the PRIMARY variables
<li>Description of the AUXILIARY variables
<li>Special Comments
<li>Normal Comments
</ul>

The first line of the file, as well as giving the File Format Index, gives the
number of lines in the header.  This allows a quick skip of the header
when reading files.</p>

<p>The order and format of the Data Originator, Storage information, and Date
information is identical for all File Format Indices.  The variable descriptions
are File Format Index specific.  The special comments and normal comments are
simple text sections reserved for adding comments to the files.  Each of the
comment sections begins with a line indicating the number of lines in
the text section.  Suggested contents of the comments sections are give in 
<a href="./metadata.html">UTLS-OZONE Suggested Metadata Standards</a>.</p>

<p>The description of the INDEPENDENT variables includes the interval between
successive values, the name, and the number of values in the independent variable. 
The descriptions of the PRIMARY and AUXILIARY variables include the variable
names, the scaling factors and any missing values.</p>

The description of the file header given here is best fleshed out with examples.
It should be noted that any line in the file header can have in-line comments. 
These are used to annotate the <a href="header1001.html">example</a> files.

<h2><a name="data">The Data Section</a></h2>
The format of the data section is determined by the File Format Index.  For the
details applied to File Format Indices other than 1001 it is best to refer to 
<a href="./forspec.txt">Gaines and Hipskind</a>.  For File Format Index 1001 the
data section is simply columns of figures.  Each column representing a different
variable.  The first column giving the values of the INDEPENDENT variables. 
The other columns list the values of the PRIMARY variables.
