<h1>UTLS-Ozone NASA-Ames filenaming conventions</h1>
<em>This is a draft document, and will change with time.</em>
<h1>Description</h1>

This page defines the filename conventions used for UTLS-OZONE NASA-Ames format 
files at the
BADC. The filename conventions reflect the content of the file: they indicate
the site or platform of the measurement, the date on which the measurement
started and the instrument and parameters measured.
</P>
<P>When submitting files to the BADC please ensure that the files comply 
to the agreed conventions.  The file name is used to automatically move
the file into the appropriate directory in the BADC archive.
It is therefore important that all files are given the correct name.</P>

<p>The filenames for NASA-Ames files are determined, in part, by the NASA-Ames
Format for Data Exchange.
The filename is of the form ppYYMMDD.xxx, where pp is a two character prefix, 
YYMMDD is a six character date and xxx is a file extension of up to 3
characters.  A commonly adopted convention, which will be implemented for
UTLS-OZONE files, is that the prefix indicates the site or platform from
which the measurements were made, and the extension gives and indication of the
instruement and physical or chemical quantity measured.  The date is the date
on which the observations recored in the file started.  At the BADC the prefix 
suffix for a particular site or instrument are inherited from previous field
campaings such as <A HREF="/data/acsoe/">ACSOE</A>.

<h1>Components of filename</h1>
<h2>Prefix</h2>

The two character prefix identifies the site or platform for the observation.
<h4>Allowed values:</h4>
<table border>
<th>Value</th><th>Description</th>
<tr><td>ab</td><td>Aberystwyth</td></tr>
<tr><td>he</td><td>Hercules C-130</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
<h2>Start date</h2>


The six character date identifies the start date of the observations in the
file. The start date is in the format YYMMDD.  The observations may span more
than one day.  The date in the file name is always the start date of the
observations.
<p>
e.g. '990110' represents  10th January 1999

<p>
<h2>Extension</h2>

The file extension identifies the instrument and constituents measured. Listed
below are the valid file extensions, together with the constituents, 
instrument, institute and group or person responsible.

<h4>Allowed values:</h4>

<th>Value</th><th>Description</th>
<tr><td>asc</td><td>Aerosol Scattering / PCASP / MRF / Richer</td></tr>
<tr><td>b2'n'</td><td>Ozone, Temperature, Pressure / Ozone-Sonde / U Wales / Vaughan</td></tr>
