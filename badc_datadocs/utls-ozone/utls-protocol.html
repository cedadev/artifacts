<P>The aims of the Data Protocol are:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>to encourage rapid dissemination of scientific results from
  UTLS OZONE.
  <LI>to protect the rights of the individual scientists funded
  by UTLS OZONE.
  <LI>to have all the involved researchers treated equitably.
  <LI>to ensure the quality of the data in the UTLS OZONE data
  archive.
</UL>

<P>These aims conflict at times, and it is hoped that the provisions
of the protocol resolve these conflicts fairly. It is recognised
that this cannot always be achieved to everyone's complete satisfaction;
there are bound to be cases where individual interests clash with
those of the UTLS OZONE programme. Therefore to try to meet these
aims, all PIs involved in UTLS OZONE, in accordance with and on
behalf of their co-investigators, must agree to abide by the following
conditions:</P>

<OL>
  <LI>Preliminary data must be made available to other UTLS OZONE
  scientists as soon as possible. There are 2 advantages to quick
  release a) planning of the future phases of the mission can be
  greatly improved, and b) scientific evaluation of the data can
  occur in a timely manner.
  <LI>Any corrections or amendments to the preliminary data should
  be announced as soon as possible.
  <LI>Validated data must be made available to other UTLS OZONE
  scientists via the BADC within 6 months of creation. The data
  will then be made available to the public domain 18 months after
  its submission to the BADC. Exceptions to these times will be
  outlined in the Implementation plan.
  <LI>Results of model studies using data acquired during UTLS
  OZONE must be made available to other UTLS OZONE scientists via
  the BADC. The time scale for submission is the same as that for
  validated data, as outlined in point 3.
  <LI>Data submitted to the BADC must be in the data format agreed
  between UTLS OZONE PIs and the BADC. All agreed metadata describing
  the data must also be supplied.
  <LI>It is each PI&#146;s responsibility to ensure that the data
  used in publications are the best available at that time.
  <LI>All scientists involved in UTLS OZONE are to have equal and
  complete access to measurements and model results produced during
  UTLS OZONE.
  <LI>If measurements or model results from other research groups
  within UTLS OZONE are used in a publication, joint authorship
  must be offered. This does not necessarily have to be accepted,
  particularly in cases where due credit and acknowledgement can
  be given in other, possibly more appropriate, ways.
  <LI>Whilst the data is restricted from the public domain (see
  point 3), each PI has the right to refuse to allow his/her work,
  whether measurement or calculation, to be used in a publication
  or presentation prior to the PI&#146;s own publication of that
  work.
  <LI>Whilst the data is restricted from the public domain (see
  point 3), no data should be transferred to a third party without
  the originator&#146;s consent.
  <LI>In the event of dispute the final decision rests with the
  UTLS OZONE Scientific Steering Committee.
