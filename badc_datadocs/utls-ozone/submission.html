<ul>

<li><b>Preliminaries</b><br><br>
To upload your data files on the BADC computer, you will need
<ol>
 <li>to have registered as a BADC user and got a password
     &#151; if you are not a BADC registered user, please
     <a href="/reg/user_register_info.html">register here</a>;
     if you are a BADC registered user but have forgotten your user ID and/or
     password, please ask help from the BADC support desk at
     <a href="mailto:badc@rl.ac.uk">badc@rl.ac.uk</a>;
 <li>to have been granted access to the <i>UTLS Ozone</i> archive
     &#151; if you do not yet have access to the UTLS Ozone 
     <A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/utls/">archive</a>, 
     please
     <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dataset_registration/dataset_info.cgi.pl?datasetid=utls">
     apply here</a>.
</ol>
<br>
<li><b><a name="filename">File format and file names</a></b><br><br>
<P>The BADC is encouraging all UTLS Ozone projects and campaigns to deliver 
data in either <a href="/help/formats/netcdf/">NetCDF</a> (binary) or 
<a href="/help/formats/NASA-Ames/">NASA Ames</a> (ASCII) format. To ensure the future usability of the 
data, it is important to include all necessary information about the data with the file. This is termed 
<a href="/help/metadata/">metadata</a>. The data files submitted should 
conform to the <a href="/help/formats/netcdf/index_cf.html">Climate and Forecasts 
(CF) Metadata Convention</a>.
If you wish to check that files are correctly formatted before uploading them 
please use the <a href="http://titania.badc.rl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/cf-checker.pl">
NetCDF format checker</a> or <a href="http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dataex_file.cgi.pl">
NASA-Ames format checker</a>.

<P>Advice on standardising filenames is provided on the 
<a href="http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/help/file_naming.html">file-naming convention page</a> 
along with a list of <a href="http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/filespec_doc?id=INSTRUMENTAL&hfile=1">common names</a> 
used for instruments, locations etc. in filenames. For data files from instruments operating on the 
FAAM aircraft, there are extra filename fields, see the <a href="http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/data/faam/file-names.html">FAAM filenaming 
convention page</a>.<P>
<p>Many data files contain the variable <i>time</i> which can be expressed in 
several ways. Guidelines on the <a href="http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/help/formats/NASA-Ames/nasa-ames-time.htm"> 
recommended format of the time-variable</a>  header lines, units and the data values in 
Nasa-Ames files are available and are based on the format used in NetCDF.<P>
     
<br>

<li><b><a name="uploading">Uploading data</a></b><br><br>
Data providers can upload their data files directly from their home computer
into the BADC <i>/incoming/utls/</i> directory, <i>via</i> the Web based
<a href="/cgi-bin/fileuploader/UTLS_directory_selection">UTLS Ozone file uploader</a>.
This device can also be used to submit software and text files containing
metadata or any relevant information on the project deliverables.
Please have your BADC user ID and password handy.
You will be asked to select the subdirectory corresponding to your project.
<p>
Alternatively, if you have a large number of files to upload, you can do so by ftp,
using your BADC userID and password.
The BADC ftp server address is <b>ftp.badc.rl.ac.uk</b> (go to /incoming/utls/ and
look for the appropriate subdirectory).
