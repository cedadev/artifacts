<H1>Status of the ERA-40 Re-Analysis Archive at the BADC</H1>
<I>This page is updated monthly to inform users of the current 
status of ERA-40 at the BADC.</I>

<HR ALIGN=LEFT>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>The BADC archives ECMWF <a href="/data/ecmwf-e40/">ERA-40 Re-analysis data</a> into two separate archives: 
<UL>
<LI>The <a href="#badc">standard BADC data archive</a> (at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Oxfordshire)</LI>
<LI>An <a href="#manchester">archive at the Manchester High-Performance Computing Centre</a> (maintained and 
updated by CGAM (Centre for Global Atmospheric Modelling) at the University of Reading).</LI>
</UL>
<P>
The reason for holding two separate data archives is to meet the requirements of two 
distinct groups of atmospheric (and other) scientists. The standard BADC archive will 
serve the data using formats and utilities that the majority of earth scientists can 
make use of. The Manchester archive, on the other hand, is aimed specifically at users 
of the modelling resources held on the high-performance computing systems. This data 
will be mainly used by members of UGAMP (the UK universities Global Atmospheric Modelling 
Programme). This page gives an overview of the contents and the current 
status of each archive. 
<P>
Links are also provided to <A HREF="#validation">validation information relating to ERA-40</A> and 
a <A HREF="/data/ecmwf-e40/news.html">latest news page for ERA-40</A>.

<H2>Production Status</H2>
The ECMWF has now completed production of ERA-40 and all the 6-hourly data is available from the BADC.
<a href="/data/ecmwf-e40/means.html">Monthly means</a> of the data are also archived.

<P>
The data in the standard archive is  held in its original 
<a href="/data/ecmwf-era/grib.html">GRIB</a> format in 
<a href="/data/ecmwf-op/grids.html#t159">T159 Spectral</a> and 
<a href="/data/ecmwf-op/levels.html#n80_reduced">N80 Reduced 
Gaussian Gridded</a> resolutions. 

<P>The BADC is developing a new system that will allow users to access 
the ERA-40 dataset in a regular gridded format. This involves the 
conversion of spectral and reduced Gaussian gridded data when the user calls the files. The 
main reason for storing all the data in the spectral and reduced Gaussian forms is 
that these formats are considerably smaller in volume than the equivalent 1&deg; x 1&deg; 
gridded data. This allows us to hold all the data on disk.

<P>
ERA-40 data is held on the following atmospheric level types:
<UL>
	<LI>Surface level.</LI>
	<LI>Model levels (1-60).</LI>
	<LI>Pressure levels (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 20, 30, 50, 70, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 775, 850, 925 and 1000hPa).</LI>
	<LI>Potential temperature levels (256, 275, 285, 300, 315, 330, 350, 370, 395, 430, 475, 530, 600, 700 and 850K).</LI>
	<LI>Potential vorticity levels (PV = +/-2).</LI>
</UL>
<P>Details about the variables available in the BADC archive are documented on the 
<a href="/data/ecmwf-e40/params.html">ERA-40 parameters page</a>. Each individual file 
holds one parameter at one time-step for the entire globe. A common  
<a href="/data/ecmwf-e40/file_naming.html">file-naming convention</a> has been adopted for 
both ERA-40 archives.
<p>
The data can be accessed using an via FTP or via our web-interface.<P>

<H2><a name="manchester">The Manchester BADC ERA-40 Archive</a></H2>
The Manchester BADC ERA-40 archive is populated and managed by Paul Berrisford of CGAM at the 
University of Reading. Documentation about the archive is available from the 
<a href="http://www.met.rdg.ac.uk/~paulb/cgam/uera40.html">CGAM web site</a>. 
The data is being stored in both <a href="/help/formats/grib/">GRIB</a> 
and <a href="/help/formats/netcdf">NetCDF</a> formats on the 128-processor Origin 2000 machine, 
<i>Fermat</i>. 

The files on Fermat are instantaneous but contain several fields (e.g. in the GRIB files  
all pressure level spectral fields are together, and in NetCDF files all pressure level fields 
are together). 
The parameters stored at 
Manchester are the same as those held in the standard BADC archive. 
Files of one type, at one analysis time, are tarred together for each available month. 
For example, all the 06:00 hour 
files are tarred into one file for January (as opposed to the standard BADC archive where 
each time-step has a separate file). A common 
<a href="/data/ecmwf-e40/file_naming.html">file-naming convention</a> has been adopted for 
both ERA-40 archives.

<P>Queries about accessing the Manchester dataset and its contents should be directed to 
<a href="mailto:P.Berrisford@reading.ac.uk">Paul Berrisford</a>. Please note that you will 
need to register as a BADC user for ERA-40 data if you want to gain access to either of the 
archives.
