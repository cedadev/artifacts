<H1>Background to the ECMWF ERA-40 Re-Analysis project</H1>

<HR ALIGN=LEFT>

<H2>Objectives</H2>
The objectives of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts</a> 
<a href="/data/ecmwf-e40">ERA-40 project</a> 
are to produce and promote use of a comprehensive 
set of global analyses describing the state of the atmosphere, land and 
ocean-wave conditions from mid-1957 to August 2002. The ERA-40 project applies 
a modern Variational Data Assimilation technique (used in daily operational 
numerical forecasting at ECMWF) to the past conventional and satellite 
observations.

<P>
<H2>Production Streams</H2>
The data is being produced in three streams, defined by the availability of 
observational data for each given period: 
<UL>
<LI><B>Stream 1 (1987-2002):</B> Assimilating the latest observation types 
(including <a href="#TOVS">TOVS</a>, 
<a href="#SSM/I">SSM/I</a>, <a href="#ERS">ERS</a>, 
<a href="#ATOVS">ATOVS</a> and <a href="#CMW">CMW</a>).</LI>
<LI><B>Stream 2 (1957-1972):</B> Pre-satellite, old observation types only.
<LI><B>Stream 3 (1972-1988):</B> Assimilating some satellite observation types 
(<a href="#VTPR">VTPR</a>, <a href="#TOVS">TOVS</a> and CMW).</LI>
</UL>

<P>
<H2>Partner Organisations</H2>
A number of partner organisations are also involved to assess the quality 
of the global analyses, they are:
<UL>
<LI>the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research, UK. 
<LI>the Koninklijk Nederlands Meteorologisch Instituut.
<LI>Météo France, Centre National de Récherches Météorologiques.
<LI>Max Plank Institut für Meteorologie, Germany.
<LI>University of Reading, Department of Meteorology, UK 
<LI>the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), USA.
</UL>
In partnership with NCAR and NCEP (National Centers for Environmental 
Prediction, USA), the ECMWF has obtained a comprehensive archive of past 
observations to supplement its original observational archives 
running from 1979 to the present day. 
A Sea Surface Temperature/Ice dataset produced by the Hadley Centre 
and <a href="#NOAA">NOAA</a>/<a href="#NESDIS">NESDIS</a> has been made available to the project through PCMDI 
(Program of Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison, USA), which 
is also participating in the quality assessment of the products. 
<P>
<H2>Improvements on ERA-15</H2>
<a href="/data/ecmwf-era">ERA-15</a>, the predecessor of ERA-40, 
covered the period January 1979 - February 1994 and used 
an earlier Optimum Interpolation analysis technique. The products are 
currently used in wide range of applications. A significant difference 
between ERA-40 and ERA-15 is in the use of satellite data. ERA-40 is using 
the TOVS radiances directly, while in 
ERA-15 temperature and humidity 
retrievals were used. In addition SSM/I Special 
and ERS data are used in ERA-40. 
The vertical resolution of the assimilating forecast model has been extended 
to 60 levels, with the top level at about 64 km. The model physics and the 
surface parametrization have been upgraded and improved since ERA-15 and 
ozone has been introduced as a model variable.
