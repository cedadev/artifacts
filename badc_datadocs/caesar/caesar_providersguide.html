<b>Data file names.</b>
<p>Data providers are kindly requested to follow the BADC
<a href="/help/file_naming.html">file name convention</a>.
Additional rules apply to <a href="../faam/file-names.html">FAAM file names</a>.
Note that the first component of the file name is the instrument (or group of
instruments, or model) name.
Please refer to the current list of standard
<a href="/filespec_doc?id=INSTRUMENTAL&hfile=1#Instrument">instrument/model names</a>.
and advise the <a href="mailto:badc@rl.ac.uk">BADC</a> if
your instrument or model is not in the list, or if you would like to record
data from
several instruments in a single file, so that we can update the list.

<br><p>
<b>Data file format.</b>
<p>Please format your data in
<a href="/help/formats/netcdf/">NetCDF</a>,
using the CF metadata conventions.
<a href="/help/formats/NASA-Ames/">NASA Ames</a> formatted files are also
accepted.
If you wish to check that files are correctly formatted before uploading them 
please use the <a href="http://titania.badc.rl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/cf-checker.pl">
NetCDF format checker</a> or the BADC
<a href="http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dataex_file.cgi.pl">NASA-Ames format
checker</a>.
<br><p>
<b>Metadata.</b>
<p>
It is important that the data be well documented.
Please follow the BADC guidelines regarding the submission of
<a href="/help/metadata/">metadata</a>.
Some standard metadata have to be provided in the data files
themselves.
Additional separate documents are welcome.
<br>
 <p>
 <b>Data file submission.</b>
 <p>In order to upload data files or documents to the BADC, you need to be
 registered with the CAESAR group &#150;
 see the "<a href="#acc">Access to data</a>" section above.
 The 
 <a href="/cgi-bin/fileuploader/CAESAR_directory_selection">CAESAR web uploader</a>
 will allow you to submit data files or documents to the BADC.
 Large amounts of files can also be submitted by ftp (please contact the
 <a href="mailto:badc@rl.ac.uk">BADC help desk</a> for further information).
