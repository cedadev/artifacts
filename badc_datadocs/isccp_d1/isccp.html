  <P>1.1 Parameter/Measurement.<BR>
<BR>
  There are 132 quantities reported for the ISCCP-C1 product for
  each 280 X 280 km map cell. These quantities are arranged into
  two groups: the first 74 values are integers representing various
  counts, while the last 58 values are real numbers representing
  physical quantities. These quantities are listed in Item 14 at
  the end of this catalog. There are 72 quantities reported for
  the ISCCP-C2 product for each 280 X 280 km map cell, consisting
  of averages of the hour-monthly mean values obtained separately
  for each of the 00, 03, 06, 09, 12, 15, 18, and 21 Greenwich
  Mean Time (GMT) time periods. In addition to mean cloud properties,
  the frequency of occurrence and average properties of ten cloud
  types are reported. These quantities are listed in Item 14 at
  the end of this catalog. <BR>
<BR>
  Count values on the tape for ISCCP-C1 and ISCCP-C2 range from
  0 to 255. Values are coded with counts from 1 to 253, with count
  0 reserved for underflow and count 254 reserved for overflow.
  Overflow occurs at lower values for pressures and cloud thicknesses.
  The count 255 is reserved to signify NO DATA. If a count value
  &lt;1 or &gt;253 is converted to a physical value, using the
  current version of the conversion tables described, the table
  returns a value of -100.0 for a count of 0, -200.0 for a count
  of 254, and -1000.0 for a count of 255. The physical quantities
  for these data are IR radiance, temperature, pressure, VIS radiance,
  reflectance, optical thickness, precipitable water amount, and
  ozone column abundance. <BR>
<BR>
  1.2 Unit of Measurement.<BR>
<BR>
  The units defined for the physical quantities in the C1 and C2
  data are: <TABLE BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="0">

  </TABLE><BR>
<BR>
  NOTE: VIS radiances and actual reflectances are both coded using
  the same table. However, the radiances are not reflectances.
  Their value represents the measured intensity as a fraction of
  the effective solar constant of the radiometer. This quantity
  divided by the cosine of the solar zenith angle is equal to a
  reflectance. Both brightness temperatures (representing IR radiances)
  and physical temperatures are also coded using the same table.
<BR>
<BR>
  The count value to physical relationship is not always linear.
  Since the radiometers measure radiances (generally with a linear
  response), the sensitivity and accuracy of the physical quantities
  derived from these radiances may not be the same over their whole
  range. For example, warm temperatures are measured more precisely
  by most radiometers than cold temperatures. It is misleading
  to present the data with the same &quot;apparent&quot; precision
  over the whole range. Hence, the temperature and optical thickness
  conversion tables are non-linear in a way that approximates the
  linear response of the AVHRR instrument: a difference of a single
  count represents a larger temperature difference for cold temperatures
  than for warm temperatures or a larger optical thickness difference
  for larger values than for smaller values. This means that a
  linear average of the count values representing temperature or
  optical thickness produces an energy-weighted result. If a different
  weighting is desired, then the conversion tables should be applied
  before averaging. All other conversion tables are linear. <BR>
<BR>
  1.3 Data Source. <BR>
<BR>
  The primary data sets used to infer the cloud properties are
  reduced resolution narrowband radiance (0.6 and 11 um) measurements
  made by the imaging radiometers on operational weather satellites
  (Schiffer and Rossow, 1985). These data, called Stage B3 data,
  have a nominal spatial resolution of 30 km and temporal resolution
  of 3 hours produced by sampling the full resolution imaging data.
  Global coverage is provided by up to five geostationary satellites
  (METEOSAT, INSAT, GMS, GOES-East and GOES-West) and up to two
  polar orbiting NOAA satellite (see Rossow et al., 1985, revised
  August 1987, for complete details). In the analysis of these
  data, two correlative data sets are utilized: data from the TIROS
  Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) operation system on the NOAA
  polar orbiting satellites and data from NOAA and US NAVY operational
  analyses of several satellite and surface measurements. The former
  provides daily, global atmospheric temperature and humidity profiles,
  plus ozone column abundances, while the latter provides weekly
  snow and sea ice coverage. <BR>
<BR>
  1.4 Data Set Identification.<BR>
<BR>
  The cloud analysis products of the International Satellite Cloud
  Climatology Project (ISCCP), called Stage C1 and C2 data, are
  constructed from the original B3 radiances, the results of the
  three parts of a cloud algorithm and the correlative data used
  in the analysis. Stage C1 data represent the global, merged results
  reported every 3 hours with a spatial resolution of 280 km; Stage
  C2 data are the monthly averages and other summary statistics
  of the Stage C1 quantities.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

  <P>4.1 Mission Objectives.<BR>
<BR>
  ISCCP focuses on the study of the distribution and variation
  of cloud radiative properties. Scientific objectives are as follows:
<BR>
  </P>
  <OL>
    <LI>To collect and analyze satellite radiance measurements to
    infer the global distribution of cloud radiative properties and
    their diurnal and seasonal variations.
    <LI>To improve the understanding and modeling of the effects
    of clouds on climate.
    <LI>To elucidate the role of clouds in the radiation balance
    (top of the atmosphere and surface) and also improve the understanding
    of the long-term global hydrologic cycle.

<BR>
  4.2 Key Satellite Flight Parameters.<BR>
<BR>
  The NOAA spacecraft are a series of satellites in 870 km (nominal)
  circular, near-polar, sun-synchronous orbits with an inclination
  angle of approximately 99 degrees (retrograde) to the equator.
  They cross the equator during local morning and afternoon (and
  corresponding night times), with an orbital period of approximately
  102 minutes. Each sequential orbit covers adjacent longitudes
  near the equator and overlapping longitudes near the poles. The
  Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) on-board this
  series is composed of up to five spectral channels with a nadir
  resolution of 1.1 km. The AVHRR 1.1 km data is not available
  globally. The AVHRR Global Area Coverage (GAC) data, with a resolution
  of 4.4 km, does provide global coverage. In addition, temperature
  sounding and ozone observations are made by the TIROS (Television
  and Infrared Operational Satellite) Operational Vertical Sounder
  (TOVS) and are used in the ISCCP analysis of B3 data. <BR>
<BR>
  The Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES)
  series consist of spin-stabilized spacecraft in geostationary
  circular orbit located over 75 degrees west longitude for GOES-East
  (5 & 7), and 135 degrees west longitude for GOES-West (6). The
  GOES-6 satellites was routinely moved to provide better coverage
  of seasonal weather events until its failure on 1/21/89. The
  GOES-7 satellite is now utilized in this manner. Data are collected
  in the visible and infrared bands by the Visible Infrared Spin-Scan
  Radiometer (VISSR). The visible channel detector consists of
  eight identical photo-multiplier tubes that scan the Earth in
  parallel, producing a visible channel resolution of 0.9 km. The
  IR detector produces a resolution of 7 km. <BR>
<BR>
  METEOSAT is in geostationary circular orbit over the equator
  centered at the Greenwich Meridian (0 degrees E longitude), with
  the exception of METEOSAT-3. METEOSAT-3 is now centered at 50
  degrees west and is functioning as a replacement for GOES-7 which
  was moved westward as in response to the failure of GOES-6. The
  Multispectral Imaging Radiometer (MIR) on METEOSAT-2, -3, -4,
  and -5 collects data over the Earth in three spectral regions,
  one in the visible and two in the infrared. The satellite scans
  the Earth from east to west and, if the water vapor channel (6.7
  um) is turned off, is capable of producing a visible resolution
  of 2.5 km. The infrared resolution is 5.0 km for both IR channels.
<BR>
<BR>
  The Geostationary Meteorological Satellites (GMS) are a series
  of satellites placed in geostationary circular orbit over the
  equator centered at 140 degrees east longitude. The VISSR onboard
  the GMS satellite collects data with four identical detectors
  operating in parallel, producing a visible resolution of 1.25
  km and an infrared resolution of 5.0 km. <BR>
<BR>
  The INSAT satellites are a series of spacecraft placed in geostationary
  circular orbit over the equator centered at 74 degrees E longitude.
  This series carries a VISSR similar to those on the GMS and GOES
  satellites, yielding a visible resolution of 1.25 km and an infrared
  resolution of 11 km. <BR>
<BR>
  4.3 Principles of Operation.<BR>
<BR>
  NOAA/AVHRR:<BR>
  The AVHRR is a four or five channel scanning radiometer that
  operates in the visible, near-infrared, and far-infrared regions.
  The fifth channel was added on the AVHRR/2 instrument flown on
  NOAA-7, -9, -11 and -12. Scanning is provided by an elliptical
  beryllium mirror rotating at 360 rpm about an axis parallel to
  the Earth. A two-stage radiant cooler is designed to provide
  a basic temperature of 95 degrees K for the IR detectors. The
  telescope is an 8-inch afocal, all-reflective system, with polarization
  of less than 10 percent. Instrument operation is controlled by
  26 commands and monitored by 20 analog housekeeping parameters.
<BR>
<BR>
  GOES/VISSR:<BR>
  The VISSR instrument operates in the visible region of 0.55 to
  0.75 micrometers and in the infrared region of 10.5 to 12.6 micrometers.
  Each of the eight photo-multiplier tubes on the visible detector
  is 0.025 X 0.021 mrads, with a dynamic range of 3-100% albedo.
  The infrared portion of the instrument consists of two detectors
  cooled to 95 degrees K, with an instantaneous field-of-view (IFOV)
  of 192 X 192 microradians. The VISSR telescope has an aperture
  of 40 cm and a focal length of 291 cm, and routes the IR wavelengths
  to separate detectors. The video analog output of all detectors
  is transmitted to the VISSR Digital Multiplexer (VDM) where it
  is sequentially sampled every 2 microseconds by the visible channel
  and every 8 microseconds by the IR channel. <BR>
<BR>
  METEOSAT/MIR:<BR>
  The Multispectral Imaging Radiometer (MIR) sensor on METEOSAT
  is a scanning radiometer which provides images in the visible
  and thermal IR regions of the spectrum. The instrument produces
  images of the full Earth disc viewed from a geostationary orbit.
  A reduced image format, corresponding to a limited band across
  the Earth's disc, may be selected by telecommand. The optical
  reflector system of the radiometer includes a movable Ritchey-Chretien
  telescope with primary and secondary mirrors. This includes a
  mirror located in the center of the primary mirror inclined at
  45 degrees to the optical axis, four folding mirrors, and a separation
  mirror for diverting light to the visible sensor. <BR>
<BR>
  The optically-collected visible and IR signals are converted
  into analog electric signals by five detectors. These are divided
  into two subsets, two visible and three IR. The detectors are
  distributed across the focal plane of the radiometer and as a
  result of the relative displacement of the detectors in this
  plane, their respective fields-of-view (FOV) do not coincide
  but are displaced relative to each other. <BR>
<BR>
  The two visible detectors are positioned in the focal plane of
  the primary telescope. Their instantaneous FOV at the Earth's
  surface (2.5 square km) is determined by their physical size
  (250 X 250 micrometers sensitive area) and the telescope's focal
  length (3650 millimeters). While the visible detectors function
  properly at ambient temperatures, the three IR detectors must
  be cooled to less than 95 degrees K. <BR>
<BR>
  Each IR detector is 70 square micrometers and generates an instantaneous
  5 km square FOV at the subsatellite point. One visible channel
  time shares with the water vapor channel so that the resolution
  of the visible image changes depending on the choice of channels.
<BR>
<BR>
  GMS/VISSR:<BR>
  The GMS Visible and IR Spin-Scan Radiometer (VISSR) is very similar
  to the scanning radiometers carried on Synchronous Meteorological
  Satellite (SMS) and GOES (1 through 3) satellites except for
  some modifications to stepping gears and detector portions. The
  number of steps in each scan is 2500 for the IR detector on GMS
  versus 1821 for GOES. <BR>
<BR>
  INSAT/VISSR:<BR>
  The INSAT VISSR is also a scanning radiometer with a visible
  channel cover- ing 0.55 to 0.75 micrometers and an IR channel
  covering the 10.5 to 12.5 micrometer spectral regions. The full
  disc can be scanned every half-hour (23 minute scan plus 7 minute
  housekeeping), processing from north to south. Sector scanning
  of the 1/4 disc (full east to west, 1/4 north to south) is possible
  every 6 minutes. <BR>

<H3><A NAME="process"></A>5. DATA PROCESSING SEQUENCE</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>5.1 Processing Steps and Data Sets.<BR>
<BR>
  The ISCCP C1 data are comprised of two Level I databases archived
  at the ISCCP Central Archive (ICA). The data have been reduced
  from the original resolutions for each of the satellites. At
  the B1 stage of processing all data sets have a nominal 10 km
  resolution except for data sets from the polar orbiters (NOAA
  series), which are retained at the original 4 km resolution.
  At the B3 stage all data sets have a nominal 30 km resolution.
  Radiance values at the 30 kilometer resolution for each of the
  sensors are normalized to the polar orbiter radiometer response.
  The cloud analysis products of ISCCP, called Stage C1 and C2
  data, are constructed from the original B3 radiances, the results
  of the three parts of the cloud algorithms, and the correlative
  data used in the analysis. Stage C1 data represent the global,
  merged results reported every 3 hours with a spatial resolution
  of 280 km; Stage C2 data are the monthly averages and the other
  summary statistics of the Stage C1 quantities. Additional information
  about the processing steps can be found within Item 5.2. <BR>
<BR>
  5.2 Derivation Techniques/Algorithms.<BR>
<BR>
  The cloud analysis algorithm for ISCCP-C1 was developed from
  a three year pilot study that compared the performance of nine
  different algorithms applied to the same data (Rossow et al.,
  1985; Rossow, W.B. and R.A. Schiffer, 1991). This algorithm has
  three fundamental parts: cloud detection, radiative transfer
  model analysis, and statistical analysis. <BR>
<BR>
  <U>A. Cloud Detection</U>. <BR>
  The cloud detection step analyzes the radiance data twice: first
  to determine an estimate for the radiance values that represent
  clear conditions and second, to determine which radiance measurements
  deviate from these clear sky values. Cloudy conditions are defined
  to be those that exhibit radiance values that are sufficiently
  different from the clear values. <BR>
<BR>
  To avoid spurious diurnal variations of cloudiness caused by
  changes in methodology associated with the presence or absence
  of VIS data, the clear sky composite procedure relies primarily
  on IR radiance tests to obtain both the VIS and IR clear radiances.
  However, since the daytime results can be improved by use of
  the VIS channel measurements, these results are incorporated
  so that the IR-only results can be reconstructed. <BR>
<BR>
  </P>
  <OL>
    <LI>Clear Sky Composites The cloud detection part of the analysis
    must separate the radiance data set into two parts: the radiance
    values representing clear scenes and those representing cloudy
    scenes (in this case a &quot;scene&quot; is one image pixel with
    a field-of-view size ranging from 4 to 8 km, depending on satellite).
    Many studies have suggested that the radiances associated with
    clear scenes are generally, though not always, less variable
    in space and time than those associated with cloudy scenes (Rossow
    et al., 1985, Seze and Rossow, 1991, and references therein,
    see Item 11.2). Thus, the cloud detection process starts by first
    testing all the radiances for low spatial and temporal variability
    to determine a best estimate of the clear scene radiance value
    at each location and time. The distribution of these clear radiance
    values is referred to as the clear sky composite. <BR>
<BR>
    The clear sky composite values are obtained as the result of
    two tests and the accumulation of three kinds of statistics over
    two time periods. The two tests for low spatial and temporal
    variability are meant to isolate many, but not all, of the clear
    image pixels from the images. The statistics are used to check
    whether these radiance values have the proper characteristics
    thought to represent clear conditions. This latter aspect of
    the algorithm is necessary because the magnitude of the radiance
    variability associated with different surface types and different
    cloud types is highly changeable. In some climate regimes the
    surface properties are much more variable; in some cases, the
    cloud properties are not highly variable. Thus, no single aspect
    of the cloud detection algorithm is successful everywhere. The
    final step of the process is an intercomparison of the results
    of all the preliminary steps to determine the best value of the
    clear radiances. <BR>
<BR>
    The first step tests the spatial variability of the IR radiances
    within small regions (about 100 km on land and 300 km over ocean).
    All pixels determined to be much colder (by 3.5 K over ocean
    and 6.5 K over land) than the warmest pixel are labelled &quot;cloudy&quot;;
    all others (including the warmest) are labelled &quot;undecided&quot;.
    The second step tests the time variability of the IR radiances
    over three days at the same GMT. All pixels determined to be
    much colder (by 3.5 K over ocean and 8.0 K over land) than the
    values at the same location either yesterday or tomorrow are
    labelled &quot;cloudy&quot;; all pixels found to be the same temperature
    (to within 1.1 K over ocean and 2.5 K over land) as they were
    either yesterday or tomorrow are labelled &quot;clear&quot;. (Performing
    comparisons at the same local time each day avoids the large
    diurnal variation of land surface temperature.) The remaining
    pixels with intermediate variability are labelled &quot;undecided&quot;.
<BR>
<BR>
    Three statistics are collected: the differences of the extremum
    radiances (maximum IR and minimum VIS) for consecutive 5 day
    periods, the number and average values of the pixels labelled
    &quot;clear&quot; for 5 day periods, and the number and average
    values of the pixels labelled &quot;clear&quot; by the time test
    and &quot;undecided&quot; by the space test. Large differences
    in the extremum radiances generally indicate remaining cloud
    contamination; low populations of &quot;clear&quot; pixels indicate
    persistent cloudiness. If these statistics suggest little cloud
    contamination, then the clear sky composite is formed from the
    5-day-average radiances of &quot;clear&quot; pixels. If the statistics
    indicate contamination, then the clear sky composite is formed
    from the 30-day-average. If the 30-day statistic (number of &quot;clear&quot;
    pixels) is too small, then the 30-day extremum radiance is used.
<BR>
<BR>
    Each pixel is labelled by the combined results of the two tests
    and the statistics. The two tests produce four categories, depending
    on whether the tests agree or disagree. The combinations (space-time
    of cloudy-cloudy, cloudy-undecided, and undecided-cloudy are
    labelled 'cloudy'; the combination of undecided-clear is labelled
    'clear'. The combination undecided-undecided is labelled 'undecided',
    while the combination cloudy-clear is labelled 'mixed'. The statistics
    indicate whether the short-term or long-term values were employed
    in the clear sky composite, (i.e., whether the clear radiance
    value is more or less accurate). All of these labels are used
    to evaluate the success of the analysis by checking their consistency.
<BR>
<BR>
    The version of the algorithm used to produce this C1 data does
    not use any correlative data to construct the clear sky composite,
    except a classification data set that indicates whether a particular
    location is land, water, or coast. The revised algorithm will
    use an augmented classification that includes topography and
    snow/ice cover. <BR>
<BR>
    <LI>Threshold Decision The final decision on the status of an
    image pixel is made by the bispectral threshold test (IR-only
    threshold at night). Using the clear sky radiances derived for
    each location and time, all image pixels with radiance values
    that are sufficiently different from clear sky conditions are
    declared to be cloudy. To improve the detection of cirrus and
    low-level clouds, single channel detections are allowed. Thus,
    if the VIS radiance or the IR radiance is different from the
    clear sky values, the pixel is called a cloud. The magnitude
    of the difference required is set by the estimate of the uncertainty
    in the clear radiance values. In these results, the VIS thresholds
    are 3.5 % to 6.0 % (land) and the IR thresholds are 3.0 deg K
    (ocean) and 8.0 deg K (land). (VIS radiances are represented
    as a percent of the instrument response obtained when measuring
    the full solar flux; IR radiances are represented as brightness
    temperatures in deg K.) Thus, if a pixel has a VIS (IR) radiance
    greater than (less than) the clear value by more than the threshold
    amount, it is considered to be cloudy. <BR>
<BR>
    This labelling of pixels as cloudy or clear is performed without
    regard to the previous labels derived from the clear sky composite
    analysis; however, the success of the cloud detection is indicated
    by whether these labels generally agree or disagree. The clear
    sky composite analysis is meant to be more conservative than
    the threshold test because the low variability of the surface
    properties means that not all measurements need to be included
    to get a good estimate of the clear radiance values. Thus, the
    image pixels are generally equally divided among the 'cloudy',
    'clear', and 'undecided' categories obtained from the clear sky
    composite analysis; the 'mixed' category is usually very small
    except when the algorithm is having difficulty distinguishing
    the clouds. The threshold decision is made for all pixels; most
    pixels labelled as 'cloudy' or 'clear' in the clear sky composite
    analysis are similarly labelled by the threshold decision, confirming
    the success of the method. The 'undecided' category contains
    radiances that are too ambiguous to make a reliable decision
    in the composite analysis. These pixels are usually divided into
    cloudy and clear in rough proportion to the number of pixels
    already labelled as cloudy or clear. This two stage decision process
    provides an &quot;error&quot; check from the internal consistency
    of the result. <BR>
<BR>
    The actual relationship between the pixel radiances and the clear
    radiances is recorded for each pixel by a two-part code: each
    part records a value from 0 to 5 representing the VIS and IR
    results separately. This preserves the ability to reconstruct
    the IR-only results in the final C1 data. <BR>

<BR>
    Uncertain-cloudy (class 4) pixels are pixels with radiance values
    that are between the threshold and two times the threshold amount.
    Because these radiances are often caused by broken clouds or
    occur when the scene is ambiguous, a count of the pixels lying
    near the threshold indicates how much the result would change
    if a different threshold value were used. This count provides
    a dynamic sensitivity monitor or uncertainty estimate. VIS-only-cloudy
    (class 2) and IR-only-cloudy (class 3) pixels are those that
    were determined to be cloudy by a single channel decision; that
    is, VIS-only-cloudy pixels have a VIS radiance that is greater
    than the clear sky VIS value by more than the threshold amount
    but have an IR radiance that is similar to the clear IR value.
    (At night there are no VIS-only-cloudy pixels and all cloudy
    pixels are IR-only-cloudy pixels.) Uncertain-clear (class 7)
    pixels are those which have a radiance value similar to the clear
    value in one channel but deviate from clear conditions too much
    in the other channel. For example, the VIS (IR) radiance may
    be similar to the clear value, but the IR (VIS) radiance is much
    warmer (darker) than the clear value. Bad-cloudy (class 5) pixels
    are similar to uncertain-clear pixels except that one channel
    has a radiance value similar to cloudy radiances. Bad-clear (class
    8) pixels have VIS and IR radiances that are much too dark and
    warm compared to the clear radiance values. Bad (class 0) pixels
    are daytime pixels with no VIS decision or any pixels with no
    IR decision (usually due to lost data). <BR>
<BR>
    A summary of the pixel-by-pixel threshold information is provided
    for each region (nominal size is 280 X 280 km) in the C1 data
    set. Cloud amount is defined in the ISCCP data as the number
    of cloudy pixels within the region. Although this approach is
    thought to overestimate cloud coverage when using &quot;low&quot;
    resolution satellite data, no technique is yet available that
    determines fractional cover of individual pixels for all cases.
    Hence, the meaning of the cloud amount reported in C1 data is
    defined by this procedure: the cloud amount obtained from this
    analysis is an &quot;effective value,&quot; which indicates the
    variation of actual cloud amount on a scale &gt;5-10 km. In C1
    the number of cloudy pixels is reported together with the total
    number of pixels; cloud fraction is the ratio of these numbers.
<BR>
<BR>
    The uncertainty estimate is provided by the number of pixels
    classified as uncertain-cloudy by the threshold and by the number
    of pixels labelled as undecided in the composite step; however,
    several other counts are summarized which indicate in different
    ways that the algorithm is or is not performing as expected.
    In particular, when the scene is ambiguous or the clear sky composite
    value is contaminated, then the number of mixed, uncertain-clear,
    bad-clear, and bad-cloudy pixels grows. Generally, the number
    of bad-clear pixels should be small. Further investigation of
    the behaviour of these &quot;error&quot; counts will improve their
    interpretation.

  <U>B. Radiative Transfer Model Analysis</U><BR>
  Once pixels are classified as cloudy or clear, the radiances
  are compared to radiative transfer model calculations designed
  to simulate the measurements of the AVHRR channels (to which
  all the radiometers have been normalized). These comparisons
  are used to isolate the surface reflectances and temperatures
  from the clear radiances and the cloud optical thicknesses and
  cloud top temperatures from the cloudy radiances. Atmospheric
  properties that affect the satellite measured radiances are specified
  from the correlative data. <BR>

  <P><BR>
  A number of consistency checks are made to determine if the radiative
  analysis is performing as expected. These checks generally detect
  problems with the data or errors in the cloud decision. Among
  the most interesting results so far is the check on the altitude
  adjustment. This procedure encounters difficulties with the optically
  thinner clouds because the VIS radiance measurement accuracy
  and the uncertainties in the calculation of the clear radiances
  from the retrieved surface reflectance prevent a meaningful measurement
  of the optical thickness. In other words, even though the cloud
  may be &quot;obvious&quot; in the IR image, its VIS radiance
  effect may be negligible. The presence of this condition is tested
  by solving the radiative transfer equation of the minimum cloud
  optical thickness consistent with the coldest possible cloud
  top temperature (cloud top at the tropopause), the surface temperature
  and the observed brightness temperature. If the retrieved optical
  thickness is less than this value (often the retrieved value
  is zero because there is no measurable difference between the
  observed radiance and the clear radiance), then the cloud top
  temperature is set to the coldest possible value and the optical
  thickness is set to its minimum value. The success of this technique
  appears good in some preliminary tests, but a refinement of this
  approach is possible. <BR>
<BR>
  Interesting results also include the check on the surface temperature
  retrieval when low cloud contamination of the clear sky radiances
  is present. This refers to the effect of undetected clouds on
  the surface temperature retrieval because the retrieval overestimates
  the atmospheric emission over the higher, but mislabelled, cloud
  tops. This causes the retrieved temperature to be colder than
  the observed brightness temperature, the opposite of the expected
  relationship. Further tests are underway to develop useful error
  flags. <BR>
<BR>
  <U>C. Statistical Analysis</U> The average and variance of each
  cloud and surface parameter are provided for the 280 km region.
  The average value is reported directly,along with the total number
  of pixels used to calculate it and the root mean square value.
  The variance is calculated from the number of pixels, the average
  value, and the root mean square value. Both the average and the
  root mean square values are decoded in the same way. <BR>
<BR>
  The reported cloud parameters represent averages over all cloudy
  pixels in each region at that time. These average values do not
  indicate the structure of the clouds present, however. Original
  ISCCP plans called for reporting the properties of five cloud
  types: low, middle, high, cirrus, and deep convective clouds.
  The latter two types were qualitatively defined to be optically
  thin and thick high clouds, respectively. Consideration of how
  best to define these types precisely, as well as studies of the
  adequacy of this classification scheme to represent the actual
  cloud structures, was part of a pilot study on the uses of ISCCP
  data. Recommendations from that study were to make the definitions
  more flexible and to preserve greater resolution in cloud top
  location and cloud optical thickness. Thus, cloud type information
  is presented in the C1 data by counting the number of cloudy
  pixels with optical thicknesses and top pressures in each of
  25 categories. (Only the five cloud top pressure categories exist
  at night. These results are reported in the first optical thickness
  class within each pressure category.) <BR>

    <LI>Different definitions that depend on the optical thickness,

  <P>A single C1 data file represents the merging of analysis results
  from all available satellites within the three hour time period;
  however, in one map cell the values from only one satellite are
  reported. Each location has an established hierarchy of satellite
  observations based on the variations of viewing geometry and
  time coverage characteristic of each satellite. For low latitudes,
  observations from the nearest geostationary satellite are preferred,
  while the polar regions (poleward of 55 degrees latitude) are
  covered only by the polar orbiter. If data from the primary geostationary
  satellites are not available, then a secondary geostationary
  satellite may be used if the viewing geometry is not too extreme.
  If no geostationary data are available at low latitudes, then
  polar orbiter data are used, if available. Since the time period
  of each data set is 3 hours long, anywhere from zero to two polar
  orbiter observations may be reported within this time period.
  The satellite that contributes the specific results is identified
  with a code number which is defined in the Volume ID file. <BR>
<BR>
  The basic objective of the ISCCP-C2 analysis is to summarize
  the cloud analysis results (Stage C1 data) on a monthly time
  scale. To preserve information about diurnal variability, the
  results are first averaged over the calendar month, separately
  for 00, 03, 06, 09, 12, 15, 18, and 21 GMT. These eight time
  periods are referred to as the hour-monthly means. The number
  of days of observations contributing to the average values is
  recorded as the sixth parameter in each map grid cell. Then,
  the hour-monthly mean values are averaged to obtain the monthly
  mean values. Hour-monthly mean values which consist of less than
  three daily observations are excluded from the monthly mean.
  Before averaging over the eight hour-monthly mean time periods
  a number of adjustments are made. <BR>
<BR>
  Averaging the quantities from Stage C1 data to produce the Stage
  C2 data can be done in two ways, depending on the purpose. Some
  quantities, such as cloud optical thickness or cloud top temperature,
  are related to the effect of clouds on radiation in a non-linear
  way. Thus, an average value meant to be indicative of the average
  radiative effect of clouds must give equal weight to these values
  proportional to their effect. Since these quantities were retrieved
  from radiation measurements, this weighting is also related to
  the variation of relative measurement precision over the range
  of the parameters. All quantities in Stage C2 data are averaged
  in this way, except for parameter 20, called PATH. For most parameters,
  this weighting procedure produces an average value that is not
  much different than that given by a simple linear average. This
  is not the case for cloud optical thickness, where a simple linear
  average produces a global monthly mean value that is about 60%
  larger than that produced by an energy-weighted average. Parameter
  17, TAU, gives the value which represents the average radiative
  effect of the clouds. Since cloud optical thickness is proportional
  to cloud water content, parameter 20, PATH, records the result
  of a simple linear average of optical thickness values. For a
  constant cloud particle size distribution (as assumed in the
  retrieval of optical thicknesses), cloud water path, WP, is given

  5.3 Special Corrections/Adjustments. <BR>
<BR>
  The method used to reconstruct the variances utilizes the mean
  and root mean square (rms) values of each quantity; however,
  this approach does not retain enough precision to report small
  variances accurately. In this version of C1 data, the variances
  are only accurate to the nearest 10% of the mean value. Since
  most variances are smaller than this amount, most variances are
  reported to be zero. <BR>
<BR>
  The mean cloud properties reported in the C1 product are the
  final values from the radiative analysis. This means that the
  daytime values of cloud top temperature (TC) and cloud top pressure
  (PC) have been altered by the effects of the VIS channel measurements.
  Since the same adjustment is not performed at night, direct comparison
  of the day and night values of cloud top temperature and pressure
  must be interpreted with caution. However, the vertical distribution
  of clouds can be reconstructed from cloud classes and the mean
  IR radiance values. The visible only (VIS-ONLY) numbers can be
  subtracted from the total number of pixels at each pressure level,
  while the IR radiances can be used to estimate the cloud top
  temperature and pressure without TAU corrections. <BR>
<BR>
  Producing the ISCCP-C2 product involved performing a number of
  adjustments on the ISCCP-C1 data before determining the monthly
  averages. The adjustments necessary included VIS adjustments
  during daytime, VIS adjustments during nighttime, calibration
  adjustments, standard adjustments, special METEOSAT adjustments,
  and diurnal adjustments <BR>
<BR>
  VIS adjustments during daytime (Adj1): <BR>
<BR>
  In the Stage C1 data, two different versions of cloud amount
  and cloud top temperature/pressure are reported for daytime conditions.
  One version of cloud amount is obtained from the IR radiances
  alone, as must be done for nighttime conditions; the other version
  combines cloud detections from both the VIS and IR radiances.
  IR radiances are insensitive to low-level clouds, especially
  broken ones, the VIS radiances analysis detects more low-level
  cloudiness than the IR analysis. Likewise, one version of the
  cloud top temperature/pressure is obtained directly from the
  IR radiances as is done for nighttime conditions and the other
  version adjusts the values consistent with the cloud optical
  thickness value retrieved from the VIS radiances. This adjustment
  is significant only for optically thin clouds, which transmit
  IR radiation from below the cloud and, consequently, appear to
  have a higher temperature/pressure than they actually do. Thus,
  the VIS/IR version is superior to the IR-only version. Stage
  C2 data contain the VIS/IR versions of cloud amount, cloud top
  temperature and cloud top pressure. <BR>
<BR>
  VIS adjustments during nighttime (Adj2): <BR>
<BR>
  The mean differences between the VIS/IR and IR-only results during
  daytime conditions are used to adjust the nighttime results in
  the hour-monthly mean data. Daytime differences between VIS/IR
  and IR-only values of total cloud amount, mean cloud top pressure
  and cloud top temperature are linearly interpolated over the
  nighttime periods between the dusk and dawn values. This interpolated
  difference is then added to the IR-only value during this time
  period. The magnitude of these corrections is generally small.
  The smaller (&lt;= 5%) cloud amount adjustments are distributed
  nearly uniformly over the globe with values slightly higher over
  ocean than over land. The larger adjustments occur in near coastal
  regions, land and ocean, in low latitudes primarily associated
  with tropical rain forests and marine stratus regimes. The unadjusted
  cloud amount is reported as the last parameter in each map grid
  cell. The cloud top pressure correction is positive where low
  clouds predominate, primarily in marine stratus regimes over
  oceans, and negative where high, thin clouds predominate, primarily
  over land, especially in desert areas. <BR>
<BR>
  Interpolation to fill during nighttime (Adj3) <BR>
<BR>
  Values of the cloud optical thickness (both TAU and PATH) are
  interpolated over the nighttime period between the dusk and dawn
  values. <BR>

  Standard adjustment (Adj4): <BR>
<BR>
  To produce Stage C1 data, results from several satellites are
  merged into a single global dataset. In regions where more than
  one satellite provides results, the merger process selects the
  preferred satellite according to a specified hierarchy that favours
  data continuity and observations made closer to nadir view. Frequency
  histograms of the differences in the overlapping measurements
  between all pairs of satellites are collected and the modal value
  estimated from the average of the mode value and the three nearest
  values above and below the mode value. These estimated differences
  for each satellite, when compared to the reference polar orbiter,
  are applied to adjust for small residual radiance calibration
  differences. The corrected quantities in the hour-monthly mean
  are: cloud top and surface temperature, cloud optical thickness
  and water path, and surface reflectance. Magnitudes of these
  corrections are illustrated in the table below. Actual calibration
  adjustments for each month are reported in the record prefixes
  for each parameter for each satellite. <BR>
<BR>
  The magnitude of the calibration adjustments applied to Stage
  C2 data to remove small residual calibration differences are
  shown here as the standard deviation and range of all corrections
  applied to each satellite over the period July 1983 - February
  1987. <BR>

  Special METEOSAT adjustment (Adj5): <BR>
<BR>
  The spectral response of the METEOSAT &quot;visible&quot; channel
  is wider than that of the other radiometers used in the ISCCP
  analysis; normalization of METEOSAT radiances is done using spectrally
  uniform targets (clouds and clear ocean areas). The spectral
  response difference means that surface reflectances calculated
  for vegetated land areas from METEOSAT are larger than for the
  other satellites. This difference in surface reflectance is removed
  in the hour-monthly mean dataset by using regression relations
  that are obtained by comparing METEOSAT and NOAA measurements
  as a function of vegetation type and season. A single relationship
  that varies with season was found to represent differences as
  a function of vegetation. Adjustment factors are applied for
  each season and are given in the table below. Unadjusted values
  can be recovered from Stage C2 data by multiplying by the slopes
  (given in the table below) and adding the intercept values. <BR>

  Diurnal adjustment (Adj6): <BR>
<BR>
  Before the hour-monthly means are combined into a monthly mean,
  small corrections are made to account for incomplete sampling
  of the diurnal variations of cloud and surface properties. An
  incomplete sample is less than 8 hour-monthly observations at
  low and middle latitudes. These adjustments are determined using
  the zonally averaged variations of the quantities in local time
  at all locations with eight hour-monthly mean values available.
  The diurnal average is calculated for the number of samples actually
  available and compared with the average of eight samples to determine
  the effect of sub-sampling on the diurnal average. The calculations
  are performed within each latitude interval, separately for land
  and water areas. The quantities that are adjusted are the total
  cloud amount, cloud top temperature and pressure, cloud optical
  thickness and water path, and the surface temperature. These
  adjustments affect only the monthly mean values and are not applied
  to the individual hour-monthly means. <BR>

  5.4 Processing Changes. <BR>
<BR>
  <U>A. Cloud Detection</U></P>
  <OL>
    <LI>Clear Sky Composites <BR>
    Since diurnal-uniform quality is desired, algorithm design has
    emphasized improvements in the accuracy of the IR tests. A number
    of very good techniques for improving the accuracy of the clear
    VIS radiance composite (cf., Rossow et al., 1985b) already exist.
    In addition, accurate models of the clear VIS radiances over
    ocean are available (Minnis and Harrison, 1984). Relatively good
    models of the land surface reflectance are also being constructed
    (see Matthews and Rossow, 1987, and references therein). Thus,
    to preserve the uniformity of the IR dependent results, while
    improving the daylight analysis results, the final clear-sky
    composite will be modified using the ocean model and the stable
    statistics of the land surface reflectances (Matthews and Rossow,
    1987). All results dependent on VIS tests will be held separately
    to facilitate diurnal studies. A comparison of the IR-only results
    with the full daytime results will also permit estimates of the
    errors derived from the nighttime analysis. Early tests show
    that removing cloud contamination only changes the clear-sky
    IR radiance by 1-3 degrees K. <BR>
<BR>
    Spatial variations of radiances can also be caused by changes
    in surface properties. Thus, the clear-sky composite will also
    be modified to avoid comparisons where snow or sea ice cover
    has changed. <BR>
<BR>
    An improved version of the statistics for the clear-sky condition
    will also be implemented. The primary purpose of the revision
    is to avoid tests that depend on single data values. For example,
    the image from GOES-East for 19 July at 12 GMT was affected by
    a spurious gain change in the IR channel. This event caused 50
    degree K colder than normal brightness temperatures, and caused
    the algorithm to classify the image as cloudy. Although the B3
    data are undergoing quality inspection that should remove this
    &quot;large&quot; error, small errors of this type will be detected
    using statistical intercomparisons of the clear radiances over
    small regions. Thus, the alternative method will allow for identification
    and elimination of spurious data values. <BR>
<BR>
    <LI>Threshold Decision <BR>
    The only planned refinements in the threshold step are the possible
    addition of two extra values for snow and ice surfaces and the
    implementation of thresholds that are linear in radiance. Many
    algorithms apply thresholds in terms of physical quantities.
    However, not all the radiometers made measurements that are linear
    in these quantities. To properly account for the radiometer performance
    and the changing sensitivity to clouds under different circumstances,
    the thresholds will be made linear in measured radiances. This
    actually introduces no change for the VIS channel; however, the
    IR radiance data are currently handled as brightness temperatures
    rather than linear counts. This change is most important in the
    polar regions where the radiometers are less sensitive to clouds
    because of the very low temperatures. This approach is more consistent
    with the interpretation of the threshold magnitude as an estimate
    of the clear sky radiance uncertainty. In addition, some refinement
    of the uncertainty and error counts discussed above may occur
    after study of the distribution and behaviour of these quantities.
  </OL>
  <P><BR>
  <U>B. Radiative Transfer Model Analysis</U> The planned refinements
  for the radiative transfer model analysis are intended to improve
  the reporting of the error checks thereby providing better documentation
  of algorithm performance. In particular, those &quot;error&quot;
  conditions that indicate cloud contamination of the clear radiances
  or improper labelling of the pixels will be added to the summary
  statistics to provide internal error estimates. <BR>
<BR>
  There have been some minor changes to the radiative analysis
  to prevent unnecessary data losses. The most noticeable problem
  in these results is that small uncertainties in the retrieval
  process can cause very low clear radiances to produce surface
  reflectances that are slightly less than zero. The current code
  discards these data causing a loss of data near the terminator
  in the images. This result suggests that the daytime analysis
  should be ended at a somewhat larger solar zenith angle (the
  cutoff is currently 81 degrees). However, these small negative
  values are also valid, but &quot;inaccurate&quot; measurements
  of a small value; hence, processing can proceed by setting small
  negative values to zero. Another problem is that the B3 data
  contain no geostationary VIS images for the three time periods
  near local midnight, even when small portions of the image actually
  have solar zenith angles larger than the cut-off value. The current
  analysis code interprets this situation as a loss of data; hence,
  portions of these images were unnecessarily discarded. Changes
  in the software logic will avoid these problems. <BR>
<BR>
  <U>C. Statistical Analysis</U> Based on further accuracy tests
  and studies of the information content of the statistics, there
  may be some refinements or changes in definitions. Suggested
  changes include adding more pressure categories in the cloud
  classification, adding an alternative VIS cloud parameter equivalent
  to the surface reflectance, and improving the height adjustment
  information to indicate how many pixels actually changed height
  categories.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>6.1 Data Validation by Producer.<BR>
<BR>
  Comparisons of parameters retrieved from the ISCCP analysis to
  other measurements of the same or related parameters shows that
  the cloud amounts are generally accurate to within 5-10% random
  and &lt;5% bias, except in polar regions (where the ISCCP cloud
  amounts are lower limits), over land areas in winter and at night
  (where ISCCP values are biased low by about 5-7%). Cloud top
  temperatures are accurate to within 2 K, with the exception of
  optical thin cirrus clouds, where the error is about 5-8K. Cloud
  optical thicknesses are accurate to about 10%, except for optically
  thin cirrus, where errors are about 25-40%. Surface temperatures
  are accurate to about 2 K over oceans and about 4 K over land.
  Surface visible reflectances are accurate to about 2-4%. <BR>
<BR>
  6.2 Confidence Level/Accuracy Judgment.<BR>
<BR>
  The overlapping portions of the first C1 data provide an opportunity
  to compare the normalized calibrations of the geostationary satellites
  directly. This comparison, though still being studied, does not
  show any significant discrepancies for July 1983. The comparison
  results suggest an uncertainty in the normalizations of no more
  than 1-3 % in visible radiances and 1-3 degrees K in IR radiances.
  This cross-check procedure will be incorporated into the operational
  C1 data production to provide further monitoring of the radiance
  calibrations. <BR>
<BR>
  6.3 Usage Guidance.<BR>
<BR>
  The C1 data products are intended to meet two objectives: 1)
  to report the &quot;results&quot; of the cloud analysis and 2)
  to aid in the identification of statistics which are meaningful
  to cloud climatology studies. The latter objective will be met
  by providing fewer statistics and more detail. This detail will
  be useful for later validation studies, algorithm improvements
  and radiative model development efforts.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

  <P>8.1 Tape Products <BR>
<BR>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.1.1 Stage C1 (ISCCP-C1) <BR>
<BR>
  Medium/Specification: C1 data are written in &quot;IBM Standard
  Label&quot; format on 9-track, 6250-bpi magnetic tapes. <BR>
<BR>
  Format and Content: Each actual data file is accompanied by additional,
  very short header and trailer files. Thus, users whose computer
  systems do not use these additional files should start reading
  with the second actual file on the tape and read every third
  file thereafter. All C1 data files are coded entirely as 1-byte
  binary values. Each data file is composed of 67 data records,
  13,200 bytes in length. There is no header record in a data file.
  Instead, each record begins with a 132-byte prefix that identifies
  the contents of that record. The prefix is followed by 99 map
  cells of data, each represented by 132 bytes. The 132 quantities
  are listed in Item 14 of this catalog. <BR>
<BR>
  Data Quantity/Rate: 2 tapes/month. <BR>
<BR>
  Status: The tapes covering the period 07/01/83 through 08/30/90
  are available. The coverage of the C1 products includes the FIRE
  (CIRRUS and MARINE STRATOCUMULUS) regions and time periods, 10/01/86
  - 11/30/86 and 06/01/87 - 07/31/87. <BR>
<BR>

<BR>
  8.3 Other Products.<BR>
<BR>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.3.1 Stage C2 (ISCCP-C2) Monthly Averages
  and Summary Statistics for ISCCP-C2 in Common Data Format (CDF).<BR>
<BR>
  Medium/Specification: Magnetic disk <BR>
<BR>
  Format and Content: The data are stored in a special data-set-independent
  format, designated the Common Data Format (CDF). CDF was developed
  as a uniform method of storing and retrieving data on magnetic
  disk. The CDF contains data and descriptions about the data.
  A standard software package called the &quot;CDF Library&quot;
  allows a user within an NCDS session to create and access these
  data and descriptions. These data contain the monthly averages
  and summary statistics for the ISCCP-C1 data at the same spatial
  resolution, including mean diurnal variations, and can be accessed
  within the Data Applications subsystem of NCDS. <BR>
<BR>
  Data Quantity/Rate: Approximately 330,000 512-byte blocks in
  72 files. <BR>
<BR>
  Status: Available online within NCDS. <BR>
<BR>
  Plans/Schedule: NCDS will continue to support this data set online,
  and update as additional data are received. <BR>
<BR>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.3.2 The Greenhouse Effect Detection
  Experiment (GEDEX) CD-ROM <BR>
<BR>
  Medium/Specifications: CD-ROM in ISO 9660 standard <BR>
<BR>
  Format and Content: The data on this disk will be stored in a
  special data-set-independent format, designated as the Common
  Data Format (CDF). CDF was developed as a uniform method of storing
  and retrieving data on disk. The CDF contains data and descriptions
  about the data. A standard software package called the &quot;CDF
  Library&quot; will be included with this CD-ROM allowing a user
  to create and access these data and descriptions. The CD-ROM
  will consist of many different data sets related to the Greenhouse
  Effect, including the ISCCP-C2 data set, and the accompanying
  NCDS data set documentation. Some of the parameters that compose
  this data set have been rederived in a manner different than
  was previously done. These changes are presented on the GEDEX
  CD-ROM. The low cloud amounts are derived from a combination
  of cumulus and stratus measurements. The amount of middle clouds
  was derived from a combination of altostratus and nimbostratus
  measurements. The amount of high clouds was derived from measurements
  of cirrus, cirrostratus, and deep convective clouds. Although
  this change in the derivation of these three parameters introduces
  a small diurnal effect, the representation of the vertical cloud
  distribution is improved. <BR>
<BR>
  Data Quantity/Rate: One CD-ROM disk set <BR>
<BR>
  Status: Release date for this product is scheduled for early
  1992. <BR>
<BR>
