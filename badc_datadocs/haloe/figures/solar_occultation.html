which is exploited by HALOE to make measurements of atmospheric
constituents.</EM>

<P>The sun is observed as it tracks through the atmosphere, and
concentrations of gases in the atmosphere are inferred from the
degree of absorption in selected spectral channels.

<P>In a solar occultation experiment such as HALOE, the attenuation
of the sun's radiation by the limb of the atmosphere is measured
as the sun rises and sets relative to the satellite. The attenuated
sunlight is measured in several IR wavebands using wide band and
gas cell correlation radiometry techniques. The time and location
of each profile is determined by the satellite orbit. The UARS
orbit has an inclination of 57&deg; and a period of about 96
minutes. This results in HALOE viewing on average 15 sunrises
and 15 sunsets each day. Due to the geometry, sunrise and sunset
events occur separately at roughly constant latitudes each day,
that is, all 15 sunrise events encircle a given latitude spaced
about 25&deg; apart in longitude each day. As the orbit precesses,
HALOE sweeps from 80&deg;S to 80&deg;N in latitude approximately every 30
days.
