<p>
The HALOE level 2 data was supplied to the BADC
in IEEE binary files by the instrument team at NASA Langley. These
files should be readable on most Unix platforms using the software
provided, but note that if you want to read the data using a DEC
alpha machine running Digital Unix, then you will have to compile
the routines using the - <I>convert big_endian</I> option. 

<P>Since the dataset is restricted, you need to <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dataset_registration/dataset_info.cgi.pl?datasetid=haloel2">apply for access to the HALOE Level 2 data</a>   
.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>You will need <B>gzip</B> installed on your local system to uncompress
  the data files and software packages - the source code is available
  from software archives. You will also need to know <A HREF="/help/howtogetdata_gzip_and_tar.html">how
  to use gzip and tar</A> once you have the files on your system.

<P>All data and software is located beneath the directory <EM><A
  HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/haloe/">/badc/haloe/</A></EM>. 
  Here you will find a README file and the following subdirectories:
<P> <UL>
    <LI><A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/haloe/data/haloel2/">data/haloel2/</A>
    - contains the HALOE Level 2 data files.
    <LI><A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/haloe/doc/">doc</A>
    - contains HALOE documentation.
    <LI><A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/haloe/software/haloel2/">software/haloel2/</A>
    - contains the example read routines and any 3rd party software available to read HALOE Level 2 data.
  </UL>
<P>Check whether the data you require is available by browsing the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/haloe/data/haloel2/">HALOE L2 
data</A> directories.

<H3><A NAME="convention"></A>3. File name convention</H3>
The file name convention adopted is as follows:&nbsp;&nbsp;
HALOE_Ll_Sssss_Ddddd.Vvvvv_Ccc_xxxx, 
<p>
where: 
<ul>
<li>l is the UARS processing level (e.g. 2), 
<li>ssss is the subtype or parameter, 
<li>dddd is the UARS acquisition day (0001 = 12 September 1991), 
<li>vvvv is the data version number (e.g. 18 or 19), 
<li>cc is the data version cycle number, and 
<li>xxxx is the file extension (PROD for the binary files).
</ul>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <H4><A NAME="structure"></A>4.1 The file structure</H4>
  <P>Level 2 data are organized into one file per day. Each daily
  file contains data for all constituents for the sunrise and sunset
  events in the day (typically 29 or 30 in total). An overview
  of the file structure is shown below. Formal file specifications
  can be found in the HALOE level 2 documentation. 
  <P>At the beginning of each file, there is a block of summary
  information. The files are then organized sequentially by event.
  The data from the event is arranged into a standard header containing
  the level 1 data used in the level 2 retrievals, and a data block
  containing the level 2 results of the retrieval. 
  <P>Schematically the file has the following structure : 
  <PRE>
 ______________________________
|                              |
|    Day Summary Block         |
|______________________________|
|                              |
|Profile 1 : Level 1 Header    |

|Profile 2 : Level 1 Header    |

  <H4><A NAME="routines"></A>4.2 The Access Routines</H4>
  <P>A set of FORTRAN subroutines to read the data are available
  from the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/haloe/software/haloel2/examples/">HALOE software</a> directory at the BADC. These are the
  routines supplied by the instrument team at NASA Langley which
  should compile and run on the majority of platforms. 
  <P>A set of access <A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/haloe/software/haloel2/3rdparty/">routines written in IDL</a> at the BADC is also
  available. 
  <H4><A NAME="3rdparty"></A>4.3 Third Party Software</H4>
  <P>In the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/haloe/software/haloel2/">software
  directories</A> for the HALOE Level 2 data, there is a subdirectory for
  3rd Party software. If you develop software to use with the HALOE Level 2
  data, then we encourage you to let us have a copy so that we
  can make it available to other researchers. </BLOCKQUOTE>
