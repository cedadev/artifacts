<P>Here is a brief outline of the HALOE instrument and the measurement
and data processing techniques which are employed. Users requiring
a more detailed description of the design and operation of the
instrument should consult the paper by <a href="/data/haloe/references.html">Russell et al. (1993a)</a>. 

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><B>1.1 </B><A NAME="description"></A><B>Instrument Description</B> 
  <P>HALOE is a satellite solar occultation experiment designed to monitor the vertical distributions of HCl, HF, CH<sub>4</sub>, and NO by gas filter
          correlation radiometry and H<sub>2</sub>O, NO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, and temperature versus pressure using CO<sub>2</sub> absorption by broadband filter radiometry
          (<a href="/data/haloe/references.html">Russell et al., 1993a</a>). Aerosol extinction is directly measured in each of the gas filter channel wavelengths which range from 2.5 to 5.26
          m (<a href="/data/haloe/references.html">Hervig, et al., 1993</a>). The broad band radiometer measurements range from 2.7 to 10 m wavelength. The absorption of solar energy
          at selected spectral bands is used to infer vertical profiles of atmospheric temperature, pressure, and mixing ratios of key gases involved
          in ozone chemistry. The HALOE instrument includes both broadband and gas filter channels covering the spectral range from 2.45 to
          10.04 microns. 
<P>HALOE uses the solar occultation technique to make measurements
  of vertical profiles of atmospheric parameters. The satellite
  observes 15 sunrises and 15 sunsets per day. For each of these
  events a vertical scan of the atmosphere is obtained by tracking
  the position of the Sun during the occultation. The technique
  is illustrated schematically in <A HREF="figures/solar_occultation.html">Figure 1
</A>. 
  <P>As each event proceeds, the instrument locks onto the sun
  and goes through a sequence of operational modes, which can be
  divided into two distinct phases : 
  <P><STRONG>An Exo-Atmospheric Reference Phase:</STRONG>In this
  phase the instrument observes the sun above the atmosphere. An
  intensity profile for the sun is measured by scanning across
  the solar disk, the gas-correlation channels are balanced (for
  sunsets only), and a sequence of calibration measurements are
  made in each spectral channel. 
  <P><STRONG>An Atmospheric Tracking Phase:</STRONG> The solar
  position is tracked through the atmosphere, and the atmospheric
  absorption is measured in each channel as a function of the pressure
  at the tangent height (defined as the altitude of the closest
  approach of the ray path to the Earth's surface). 
  <P>The order in which these two steps are performed depends on
  whether the event is a sunrise or a sunset. 
  <P>Gas mixing ratio profiles are then determined by taking the
  ratio of the solar intensity which has been attenuated by its
  passage through the atmosphere with the unattenuated intensity
  measured outside the atmosphere. The use of a relative measurement
  means that the instrument is virtually self-calibrating. 
  <P>The instrument uses Gas Filter Correlation Radiometry to make
  measurements of HCl, HF, CH<sub>4</sub> and NO, and Broadband Filter Radiometry
  for measurements of O<sub>3</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, NO<sub>2</sub> and the temperature as a function
  of pressure using a CO<sub>2</sub> channel. Aerosol extinction is also measured
  in each of the gas filter channels. <BR>


<P>
<b>1.2 <A NAME="techniques"></A>Measurement Techniques. </b>

<P>1.2.1 Gas Filter Correlation Radiometry (HCl, HF, NO, CH<sub>4</sub>) 

<P>Solar energy enters the gas correlation section of the instrument
and is divided into two paths for each channel. The first path
contains a cell filled with a sample of the gas to be measured;
the second is a vacuum path. The output signals from the detector
in each of these paths are fed into a differencing amplifier,
where a differenced signal is calculated. 

<P>In the reference phase of an occultation event, when the instrument
observes the sun above the atmosphere, the gains of the two channels
are balanced, so that the difference signal is close to zero. 

<P>During the atmospheric tracking phase, absorption by the target
species in the atmosphere changes the spectrum of the incoming
radiation in a way which is strongly correlated with the absorption
line spectrum of the gas cell. This introduces a difference signal,
from which the concentration of the target gas in the atmosphere
may be derived. 

<P>Since absorption by aerosol is spectrally broad, it may be
taken as flat across the bandpass of a single HALOE channel. affecting
both the gas-cell path and the vacuum path equally. As a result
it does not contribute to the differenced signal. Once the mixing
ratio of the target gas has been derived, the broadband signal
in the vacuum path is used to derive the aerosol transmission. 

<P>1.2.2 Broadband Filter Radiometry (H<sub>2</sub>O, NO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>,CO<sub>2</sub>) 

<P>These channels are conventional broadband filter radiometers.
The instrument signal is a direct measurement of the energy absorbed
during occultation. The ratio of the atmospheric signal to the
exo-atmospheric signal is a measure of the atmospheric transmission
in the optical path. Aerosol absorption has a large effect on
the radiometer measurements but signal correction methods have
been developed (<A HREF="references.html">Hervig et al., 1993</A>) and used successfully to
derive mixing ratios. 

<b><P>1.3 <A NAME="process"></A>Data Processing Techniques</b> 

<P>The <A HREF="/data/uars/">UARS</A> data processing is carried
out at the Central Data Handling Facility at the Goddard Space
Flight Center using software supplied by the Instrument's Principal
Investigator group. 

<P>The data processing for UARS instruments consists of a progression
through a sequence of `levels' from the raw telemetry at level
0 to geophysical quantities interpolated onto standard grids at
level 3. The processing steps for HALOE are outlined below : <STRONG>Level
0-1</STRONG> At the level 0-1 processing step, instrument-specific
effects are removed and a set of calibrated data are derived in
physical units (eg. voltages and radiances) tagged with their
locations. 

<P><STRONG>Level 1-2</STRONG> The level 1 data are then processed
further to produce the level 2 product which contains vertical
profiles of temperature, pressure, mixing ratios of chemical constituents
and aerosol extinctions at the measurement positions. This step
involves a complex `onion-peeling' algorithm in which species
are retrieved layer-by-layer from the top of the profile downwards,
using the data from the layers above to retrieve at lower levels. 

<P>For each event the pressure and temperature retrievals are
performed first, followed by the mixing ratios and aerosol extinctions.
The order in which the retrievals are carried out is important,
since some species are spectral contaminants in other channels.
Where this happens, retrievals are repeated using the derived
profiles from the contaminant channel to improve the original
retrieval. 

<P>The level 1-2 processing step also requires data on spectral
line parameters and spectral filter functions for the gas-filter
functions and band averaged emissivity tables for the radiometer
channels. 

<P><STRONG>Level 2-3A</STRONG> The level 2 data are profiles located
at the measurement positions which are determined by the Sun-satellite
geometry. The level 2-3A processing step takes these data and
interpolates them onto a standard set of vertical levels evenly
spaced in pressure, and onto standard times (level 3AT) and standard
latitudes (level 3AL).

<H3>2.<U> </U><A NAME="data"></A><U>The Level 2 Data</U></H3>

<P>The data available through the BADC are in level 2 files. These
consist of day files containing vertical profiles for all of the
parameters measured. There are typically 29 or 30 profiles per
day corresponding to each occultation event. The HALOE level 2
data are not public and users who require access to the HALOE data must apply for a web account
at the BADC.

    <P>Note that these data have not been interpolated; the level
    2 profiles are provided at the location of the measurements and
    are not on a regular pressure grid. 
    <P>The vertical coverage is illustrated in <A HREF="figures/haloe_vert_coverage.html">Figure 2

    <P>2.1.2 Horizontal Coverage
    <P>As HALOE only makes measurements during sunrise and sunset
    it does not operate continuously. 
    <P>The locations of the HALOE profiles varies with the spacecraft-Earth-Sun
    geometry. For a given day, the locations tend to be in two distinct
    latitude bands with 14 - 15 sunrises in one band and 14 - 15
    sunsets in the other. These bands are typically in opposite hemispheres.
    The longitudinal separation of profiles in each band is approximately
    24&deg;, and a day's measurements therefore covers the full
    longitude range. 
    <P>The latitudes of successive events of one type (e.g. sunsets),
    shift over the course of a day. The magnitude of the shift varies
    with latitude. Near the equator it may be as much as 10&deg;
    per day, whereas at high latitudes measurements lie almost along
    zonal circles. The total sweep from high latitude in one hemisphere
    to high latitude in the other takes between 2 and 6 weeks, and
    the maximum latitude reached varies, the extremes being 80&deg;
S and 80&deg;N. The latitude range covered by the measurements
    is shown in the BADC catalogue, and a typical range over the
    course of a year is shown in <A HREF="figures/haloe_lat_coverage.html">

  <H4><A NAME="resolution1"></A>2.3 Resolution</H4>
  <P>The vertical resolution of the data varies with channel and
  is not equivalent to the vertical spacing in the level 2 file.
  Several factors contribute to the resolution. Instrument optics,
  signal measurement bandwidth and data processing procedures are
  the primary factors. Although the field of view projects to roughly
  1.6 km at the limb, when combined with the electronic bandpass
  and solar sink/rise rate, the natural instrument resolution varies
  between about 2 and 3 km, (depending on the sink rate). Events
  viewed parallel to the orbital plane have faster sink rates than
  events viewed at large angles to the orbital plane (large beta
  angle) 
  <P>The resolution can be further degraded by the processing.
  In fact, nearly any attempt at improving the stability of retrievals
  has the consequence of smoothing results in the vertical. The
  lower the signal-to-noise (S/N) the more instability, requiring
  more smoothing. 
  <P>Each HALOE channel is processed with point spacing and smoothing
  chosen to give a good balance between stability and resolution.
  The low S/N regions (mainly upper altitudes) are smoother than
  the high signal regions. For the radiometer retrievals (NO<sub>2</sub>,
  H<sub>2</sub>O, O<sub>3</sub> and aerosols) the advantages of the highly over sampled
  HALOE data are used to achieve results very close to the natural
  instrument resolution in regions of sufficient signal. The computationally
  intensive gas channels (HF, HCl, CH<sub>4</sub> and NO) have been limited
  to 3 km point spacing in the processing, which limits effective
  resolution to about 4.5 km. At high altitude (dependent on channel,
  but always above the stratopause), an additional smoothing of
  the signal is performed, before processing, that is inversely
  proportional to S/N. This smoothing starts when signals drop
  below a S/N of 20 and is limited to no more than a 5 km smoothing.
  Consequently, resolution at the higher altitudes will be closer
  to 6 or 7 km, quickly improving as signal increases at lower
  altitudes. Although variable smoothing can violate conservation
  of signal rules, the error is a very small fraction of total
  estimated error. 
  <P>Estimated resolutions for each species are tabulated in the
  instrument team's <A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/haloe/doc">data
  quality</A> document. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
   
  <H4><A NAME="quality1"></A>2.4 Data Quality</H4>
  <P>The data have undergone extensive validation. They have been
  compared to a variety of correlative measurements, as well as
  data from other <A HREF="/data/uars/">UARS</A> instruments. Although
  all channels have produced high quality results, there are known
  and suspected errors; these are outlined below, using information
  taken from documentation supplied by the HALOE team. 
  <P>For each mixing ratio profile in the level 2 file, there is
  an accompanying quality profile which is a measure of the `random'
  error in that species, expressed in standard deviation. 
 
    <p>2.4.1 General considerations
    <P>The single most difficult problem to address in processing
    HALOE data has been the increased aerosol extinction in the lower
    stratosphere due to the Mt. Pinatubo eruption (June 1991, 12
&deg;N). The Aerosol cloud rose to ~40km in January 1992 and
    spread globally, before subsiding. The worst problems occurred
    in the equatorial lower stratosphere in the first few months
    of operation. 
    <P>The aerosol has induced problems through two distinct mechanisms;
    contaminate absorption and degraded solar tracking. 
    <P>Results from the radiometer channels may be in error by as
    much as 20-30% due to error in estimating the aerosol extinction
    under the heavy aerosol conditions prevailing after the Pinatubo
    eruption. Since the aerosol can contribute up to 80% of the absorption
    in some channels when aerosol levels are high (typically the
    tropics and subtropics from October 1991 and throughout 1992
    around the aerosol peak). 
    <P>The second mechanism, degradation of the ability to track
    the sun, leads to a reduced altitude registration accuracy. Early
    in the mission, HALOE profiles often cut-off with a minimum altitude
    in the mid stratosphere. There is an additional problem with
    the tracking mechanism when the sun is within a small angle of
    thick aerosol layers, which leads to errors in the mixing ratio
    profiles which are near constant or decrease with pressure, principally
    H<sub>2</sub>O and CH<sub>4</sub>. This problem can manifest itself as pockets of apparently
    dry air at the lower altitudes in the tropics and sub-tropics.
    The effect is typically under 10%, but can be as high as 30%. 
    <P>The tracking fidelity also degrades at low altitude (below
    18 km) for a variety of other reasons, making results below the
    450K surface quite variable for all channels and all products..
    The measurement at the bottom point in a profile is made close
    to the time at which the Sun lock was acquired or lost, so the
    time delay in the instrument response can result in a corrupted
    datum for this point. Considerable effort has been devoted to
    this problem, but there is some evidence that occasional rogue
    values persist. 
    <P>Above the aerosol layer the data quality is limited primarily
    by the random errors tabulated in the data files. However, certain
    conditions related to both the atmosphere and instrument can
    be more error prone than others. Major systematic errors are
    mostly limited to the lower stratosphere and troposphere. 
    <p>2.4.2 Individual species<p>
    <P>For information about the quality of the measurements of individual
    species, users should refer to the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/haloe/doc/haloe_l2.sfdu">documentation</A>

<H3>3.<U> </U><A NAME="data"></A><U>The Level 3A Data</U></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4><A NAME="description2"></A>3.1 Data Description</H4>

Level 3AT data consists of atmospheric profiles on a vertical spacing 
corresponding to the standard UARS pressure grid.  In many cases this vertical
spacing is much broader than the HALOE Level 2 point spacing.  For this 
reason, HALOE Level 3AT data is not always representative of the HALOE Level 
2 data from which it was produced.  Therefore, care should be taken in 
interpreting the HALOE Level 3AT data between the UARS standard pressure 
levels.  Also, the temperature profiles are retrieved on a 1.5 kilometer
grid, interpolated to a 0.3 kilometer grid, and then interpolated to the
UARS Level 3AT pressure grid.  The temperature standard deviation values, on
the other hand, are taken directly from the 1.5 kilometer gridded values.
The standard deviation value of -999.0 indicates a temperature value from 
NMC or climatology.
<p>
With the last few points of all HALOE Level 2 profiles being suspect, large 
variations may occur at the bottom of the profiles.  On rare occasions the 
Level 3AT interpolation will wash out these variations and they will be 
reduced or not appear at all in the interpolated 3AT profile.  In cases 
where this occurs, the comment associated with the quality number will not
accurately describe the bottom of the profiles.
<P>Level 3AT data is organized into thirteen files per day, one each for 
temperature, mixing ratios of H<sub>2</sub>O, NO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, NO, CH<sub>4</sub>, HCl, and HF, and aerosol
extinction values for CO<sub>2</sub>, NO, CH<sub>4</sub>, HCl, and HF channels.  Each file contains 
the retrievals for the sunrise and sunset events for the day (typically 29 or 
30 total), and files are organized by event.  The two Level 3TP files are 
latitude and longitude for each pressure level of each event for the day.


<H4><A NAME="spatial"></A>3.2 Spatial Coverage and Resolution</H4>
    
<P>Latitudinal coverage is from 80&deg;S to 80&deg;N over the course of a year and includes 
extensive observations of the Antarctic region during spring. The latitude and
longitude locations of the actual retrievals vary with each retrieval point due
to motion of the spacecraft during the length of the occultation event. For this
reason, two HALOE level 3TP parameter files are produced, one containing the
latitude and one containing the longitude at each UARS pressure level for each
HALOE event. Also the level 3AT data are assigned a latitude/longitude location
corresponding to that of the 30km retrieval point.

<P>Horizontal resolution is 4&deg; for level 3AL files and about 495 km along the orbital track
for level 3AT files.<BR>
Vertical resolution for level 3A files is about 2.5 km between pressure surfaces.

<H4><A NAME="resolution"></A>3.5 Resolution</H4>

The gridded Level 3a product is put on UARS standard pressure grid points that result in roughly 
a 2.5 km point spacing.  This can severely alias the HALOE O<sub>3</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, NO<sub>2</sub> and aerosol data which often resolve real features under 2 km in height (although 
at reduced amplitude).  Therefore, if the higher resolution information is important to the user, the Level 2 product should be used.  It is planned for 
future releases to include a product for delivery to the DAAC with a format nearly identical to 3a but with a grid spacing closer to 0.5 km. This will 
coincide with future HCl, HF, CH<sub>4</sub> and NO releases at point spacings near 1 km to attain a resolution closer to the natural 2-3 km  instrument 
resolution.  (Note that for this discussion we define a resolution, say 4 km, as a Gaussian apodization of the perfectly resolved signal transform 
in which the amplitude of an 8 km wave (needed to detect 4 km features) would be attenuated by 50%.  Therefore even 1 km features may be detected 
with sufficient sampling, although the amplitude would be reduced by 94%.)



<H4><A NAME="quality"></A>3.6 Data Quality</H4>
  The data have undergone extensive validation. They have been
  compared to a variety of correlative measurements, as well as
  data from other <A HREF="/data/uars/">UARS</A> instruments. Although
  all channels have produced high quality results, there are known
  and suspected errors; these are outlined below, using information
  taken from documentation supplied by the HALOE team. 
  
 
    <p>3.6.1 General considerations
    <P>The single most difficult problem to address in processing
    HALOE data has been the increased aerosol extinction in the lower
    stratosphere due to the Mt. Pinatubo eruption (June 1991, 12
&deg;N). The Aerosol cloud rose to ~40km in January 1992 and
    spread globally, before subsiding. The worst problems occurred
    in the equatorial lower stratosphere in the first few months
    of operation. 
    <P>The aerosol has induced problems through two distinct mechanisms;
    contaminate absorption and degraded solar tracking. 
    <P>Results from the radiometer channels may be in error by as
    much as 20-30% due to error in estimating the aerosol extinction
    under the heavy aerosol conditions prevailing after the Pinatubo
    eruption. Since the aerosol can contribute up to 80% of the absorption
    in some channels when aerosol levels are high (typically the
    tropics and subtropics from October 1991 and throughout 1992
    around the aerosol peak). 
    <P>The second mechanism, degradation of the ability to track
    the sun, leads to a reduced altitude registration accuracy. Early
    in the mission, HALOE profiles often cut-off with a minimum altitude
    in the mid stratosphere. There is an additional problem with
    the tracking mechanism when the sun is within a small angle of
    thick aerosol layers, which leads to errors in the mixing ratio
    profiles which are near constant or decrease with pressure, principally
    H<sub>2</sub>O and CH<sub>4</sub>. This problem can manifest itself as pockets of apparently
    dry air at the lower altitudes in the tropics and sub-tropics.
    The effect is typically under 10%, but can be as high as 30%. 
    <P>The tracking fidelity also degrades at low altitude (below
    18 km) for a variety of other reasons, making results below the
    450K surface quite variable for all channels and all products..
    The measurement at the bottom point in a profile is made close
    to the time at which the Sun lock was acquired or lost, so the
    time delay in the instrument response can result in a corrupted
    datum for this point. Considerable effort has been devoted to
    this problem, but there is some evidence that occasional rogue
    values persist. 
    <P>Above the aerosol layer the data quality is limited primarily
    by the random errors tabulated in the data files. However, certain
    conditions related to both the atmosphere and instrument can
    be more error prone than others. Major systematic errors are
    mostly limited to the lower stratosphere and troposphere. 
    <p>3.6.2 Individual species<p>
    <P>For information about the quality of the measurements of individual
    species, users should refer to the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/haloe/doc/haloe_l2.sfdu">documentation</A>
    produced by the instrument team which gives a detailed discussion
    of measurement errors and vertical resolution for each species
    measured by the instrument.
