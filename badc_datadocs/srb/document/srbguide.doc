1.0       TYPE OF DATA

1.1       Parameter/Measurement, Units of Measurement

Fifty-eight quantities are reported for the SRB Shortwave Data Package
(excluding data date and processing date). There are 50 monthly average
quantities and 8 daily average quantities.  The principle parameters in the
data package are Pinker and Staylor (SRB satellite algorithms) calculated
irradiances for the surface and top-of-atmosphere.  Ground truth values
for downward shortwave irradiance and an accuracy assessment are also
included.  SRB uses the same equal area grid system as that used by the
International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) for its C1
products.  The equal-area grid contains 6596 cells covering the globe;
where a cell is approximately 280km X 280km at the equator.  Ground
truth values for downward shortwave irradiance and an accuracy
assessment are also included.

The SRB Shortwave Data Package parameters and their units are listed
below.

	 53 GMS-3
	 54 GMS-4

  8.  NUMBER OF GROUND TRUTH SITES IN CELL, DIMENSIONLESS (GEBA Subset).

  9.  NUMBER OF DAYS OF MISSING ISCCP RADIANCE DATA THAT WERE FILLED,
      DAYS (STAYLOR VALUE).

      This number allows the user to know how much radiation
      data for this cell are based on real ISCCP data and how much
      are based on fill values obtained by interpolation.  The
      PINKER ALGORITHM also fills over gaps of missing data.

 10.  STAYLOR SNOW/ICE COVER, PERCENT OF MONTH.

      This is the percentage of time when snow/ice cover is greater
      than 10 percent and the surface temperature (ISCCP
      PARAMETER 115) is less than 285 DEG K over a 5-day
      period.  The value is calculated as a percentage of days when
      actual data are available.  Thus, data gaps are assumed to
      have the same snow/ice frequency as data days.  When
      average   surface temperature is greater than 285 DEG K over
      a 5-day period, Staylor assumes that the snow/ice cover has
      melted and modifies ISCCP PARAMETER 13 to zero snow/
      ice cover.

      daylight values of ISCCP parameter 5 over the month).

 17.  ISCCP SURFACE TEMPERATURE (ISCCP CLOUD-IMAGER PRODUCT), DEG K (linear
      average of daylight values for ISCCP parameter 89 over the month).

 18.  ISCCP TOTAL COLUMN PRECIPITABLE WATER, CM (linear average of the
      daylight sum of ISCCP parameters 127, 128, 129, 130, and 131 over the month).

 19.  ISCCP TOTAL COLUMN OZONE, DOBSON UNITS (linear average of daylight
      values of ISCCP parameter 132 over the month).

      (linear average of daytime values of ISCCP clear-sky composite scaled
      radiance divided by solar zenith angle [ISCCP parameter 110/isccp
      parameter 14], See WMO/TD- No. 58, Revised August 1987, page 16 for discussion).

1.2       Data Source

SRB has a variety of data sources.  The primary source is the International
Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) C1 monthly dataset. The
ISCCP product provides input for the Staylor and Pinker satellite
algorithms.  Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) data are also
used - as input to the models, as well as for top-of-atmosphere (TOA)
irradiance comparisons with the Pinker Model output.  The Swiss Federal
Institute of Technology, Zurich, provides ground-truth fluxes from the
Global Energy Budget Archive   (GEBA).  This data is used for validation
of the Pinker and Staylor calculated downward shortwave surface
irradiances.

(1) Global coverage over a period of approximately 24 hours.

(2) For better coverage of seasonal weather events, GOES-6 was moved
to 98 W on August 30, 1984; to 108 W on November 22, 1984, back
to 98 W on July 28, 1986, and to 135 W from April 1987 until its
failure on 1/21/89.

(3) For better coverage of seasonal weather events, GOES-7 is positioned
between 98W and 108W, with a position of 98W during the tropical
convective season.  This regular change in positions will occur until
GOES-I becomes operational, approximately late 1993.

(4) METEOSAT-3 was positioned to 50 deg W in early August 1991 to
supplement the coverage of GOES-7.  This move was necessary in
order to provide coverage of Atlantic weather events during the
absence of a GOES East Satellite.

2.2       Spatial Resolution

The SRB data package uses the ISCCP C1 equal-area map grid consisting
of 6596 cells covering the entire globe. The C1 dataset is on an equal-area
grid (the dimension of a cell at the equator is about 280 km X 280 km).The
spatial resolution of the ERBE dataset is 2.5 degrees X 2.5 degrees on an
equal-angle grid.  The ERBE dataset is converted to equal-area resolution
using a weighting technique.

    NOAA-12 and replaced NOAA-10 as the morning satellite.

3.2        Temporal Resolution

The SRB data package represents global, merged results from a variety of
data sources (listed previously).   Fifty parameters are reported as monthly
averages, eight parameters are reported as daily averages.

4.0      INSTRUMENT DESCRIPTION

4.1     Mission Objectives

The mission objectives of SRB are to use the ISCCP C1 data
supplemented with ERBE data as input to the SRB satellite algorithms to
estimate various top-of-atmosphere and surface parameters.  Where
GEBA data are available and determined by Satellite Data Analysis
Center (SDAC) to be accurate, it is compared with both algorithm's
calculation of downward shortwave irradiance at the surface.



4.2     Key Satellite Flight Parameters

The NOAA spacecraft are a series of satellites in 870 km (nominal)
circular, near-polar, sun-synchronous orbits with an inclination angle of
approximately 99 degrees (retrograde) to the equator.  They cross the
equator during local morning and afternoon (and corresponding night
times), with an orbital period of approximately 102 minutes.  Each
sequential orbit covers adjacent longitudes near the equator and
overlapping longitudes near the poles.  The Advanced Very High
Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) on-board this series is composed of up
to five spectral channels with a nadir resolution of 1.1 km.  In addition,
temperature sounding and ozone observations are made by the TIROS
(Television and Infrared Operational Satellite) Operational Vertical
Sounder (TOVS) and are used in the ISCCP analysis of B3 data.

The Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) series
consist of spin-stabilized spacecraft in geostationary circular orbit located
over 75 degrees west longitude for GOES-East (5 & 7), and 135 degrees
west longitude for GOES-West (6).  The GOES-6 satellite was routinely
moved to provide better coverage of seasonal weather events until its
failure on 1/21/89.  The GOES-7 satellite is now utilized in this manner.
Data are collected in the visible and infrared bands by the Visible Infrared
Spin-Scan Radiometer (VISSR).  The visible channel detector consists of
eight identical photo-multiplier tubes that scan the Earth in parallel,
producing a visible channel resolution of 0.9 km.  The IR detector
produces a resolution of 8 km.

The Meteorological Satellite (Meteosat) series are operated by the
European Space Agency and are in geostationary circular orbit over the
equator centered at the Greenwich meridian (0 degrees E longitude), with
the exception of METEOSAT-3.  METEOSAT-3 is now centered at 50
degrees west and is functioning as a replacement for GOES-7 which was
moved westward in response to the failure of GOES-6.  The Multispectral
Imaging Radiometer (MIR) on METEOSAT-2, -3, -4, and -5 collect data
over the Earth in three spectral regions, one in the visible and two in the
infrared.  The satellite scans the Earth from east to west and, if the water
vapor channel (6.7 um) is turned off, is capable of producing a resolution
of 2.5 km.

The Geostationary Meteorological Satellites (GMS) are a series of
satellites operated by the Japan Meteorological Agency.  They are located
in geostationary circular orbit over the equator centered at 140 degrees
east longitude.  The VISSR on board the GMS satellite collects data with
four identical detectors operating in parallel, producing a resolution of
1.25 km

4.3     Principles of Operation

NOAA/ AVHRR:

 The AVHRR is a four or five channel scanning radiometer that operates
in the visible, near-infrared, and far-infrared regions.  The fifth channel
was added on the AVHRR/2 instrument flown on NOAA-7, -9, -11 and -
12.  Scanning is provided by an elliptical beryllium mirror rotating at 360
rpm about an axis parallel to the Earth.  A two stage radiant cooler is
designed to provide a basic temperature of 95 degrees K for the IR
detectors.  The telescope is an 8-inch afocal, all-reflective system, with
polarization of less than 10 percent.  Instrument operation is controlled by
26 commands and monitored by 20 analog housekeeping parameters.

GOES/VISSR:

The VISSR instrument operates in the visible region of 0.55 to 0.75
micrometers, and in the infrared region of 10.5 to 12.6 micrometers.  Each
of the eight photo-multiplier tubes on the visible detector is 0.025 X 0.021
microradians (mrads), with a dynamic range of 3-100% albedo.  The
infrared portion of the instrument consists of two detectors cooled to 95
degrees K, with an instantaneous field-of-view (IFOV) of 192 X 192
mrads.  The VISSR telescope has an aperture of 40 cm and a focal length
of 291 cm, and routes the IR wavelengths to separate detectors.  The video
analog output of all detectors is transmitted to the VISSR Digital
Multiplexer (VDM) where it is sequentially sampled every 2
microseconds by the visible channel and every 8 microseconds by the IR
channel.

METEOSAT/MIR:

The Multispectral Imaging Radiometer (MIR) sensor on METEOSAT is
a scanning radiometer which provides images in the visible and thermal
IR regions of the spectrum.  The instrument produces images of the full
Earth disc viewed from a geostationary orbit.  A reduced image format,
corresponding to a limited band across the Earth's disc, may be selected
by telecommand.  The optical reflector system of the radiometer includes
a movable Ritchey-Chretien telescope with primary and secondary
mirrors.  This includes a mirror located in the center of the primary mirror
inclined at 45 degrees to the optical axis, four folding mirrors, and a
separation mirror for diverting light to the visible sensor.

The optically-collected visible and IR signals are converted into analog
electric signals by five detectors.  These are divided into two subsets, two
visible and three IR.  The detectors are distributed across the focal plane
of the radiometer and as a result of the relative displacement of the
detectors in this plane, their respective fields-of-view (FOV) do not
coincide but are displaced relative to each other.

The two visible detectors are positioned in the focal plane of the primary
telescope.  Their instantaneous FOV at the Earth's surface (2.5 square km)
is determined by their physical size (250 X 250 micrometers sensitive
area) and the telescope's focal length (3650 millimeters).  While the
visible detectors function properly at ambient temperatures, the three IR
detectors must be cooled to less than 95 degrees K.

 Each IR detector is 70 square micrometers and generates an instantaneous
5 km square FOV at the subsatellite point.  One visible channel is time
sharing with the water vapor channel so that the resolution of the visible
image changes depending on the choice of channels.

GMS/VISSR:

The GMS Visible and IR Spin-Scan Radiometer (VISSR) is very similar
to the scanning radiometers carried on Synchronous Meteorological
Satellite (SMS) and GOES (1 through 3) satellites except for some
modifications to stepping gears and detector portions; the number of steps
in the scan is 2500 for the IR detector on GMS versus 1821 for GOES.

5.2      Derivation Techniques/Algorithms

DESCRIPTION OF PINKER METHOD:

The algorithm was developed at the UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND by
R. T. Pinker and I. Laszlo who supplied this ASCII character
documentation.  It is a physical model based on radiative transfer
calculations using the delta- Eddington approximation.  The model is an
improvement on earlier concepts (Pinker and Ewing, 1985) and is more
fully described in Pinker and Laszlo (1992).

 Conceptual Framework:

Reflectivity (R), transmissivity (T), and absorptivity (A), of the
atmosphere (clear or cloudy) can be determined by the following set of
optical parameters: optical depth (TAU); single scattering albedo
(OMEGA); and phase function/asymmetry parameter (g).  It has been
demonstrated that a reverse application, i.e., the retrieval of these
parameters from the measurements of R, T and A is also possible, namely,
that information on optical depth can be recovered from satellite data and
that the visible albedo provides the most sensitive measure of optical
depth.  Using similar concepts, a low resolution spectral model in the 0.2-
4.0 micrometer range, was formulated for computing T from satellite
observations of top of the atmosphere (TOA) reflectivity (R); if the
transmissivity (T), of the atmosphere is known, one can also compute the
downwelling radiation at the surface.

The method is based on relating the broadband (0.2-4.0 micrometer)
transmissivity, T, (ratio of the irradiance at the surface to that at TOA) to
the broadband TOA reflectivity, R, (ratio of the reflected flux at TOA to
the TOA irradiance).  Once the relationship, T = f(R) is known, T (and the
surface irradiance, SWDN) can be computed by using R as determined
from the satellite measured narrowband radiance.  Three major steps are
involved.  First, relationships of the type T = fi(R), i = 1, ... N, representing
N realistic atmosphere/surface conditions are established through
radiative transfer computations of transmitted and reflected radiation.
Each of the N different conditions is characterized by a specific surface
albedo, given amounts of absorbing gases (ozone; water vapor) and
scatterers (molecules; aerosols; cloud droplets).  Next, a broadband TOA
albedo, RSAT, is determined from the satellite measurement.  Finally, the
relationship, T = fs(R), pertaining to the atmosphere/surface condition (S),
that existed when the satellite measurement was taken, is selected from the
results of the first step, and an estimate of T (and SWDN) is obtained by
matching the satellite derived broadband albedo, RSAT, to an albedo (R)
computed in the first step. The first step has to be performed only once and
the results of the radiative transfer computations can be stored in a data
library.  Steps 2 and 3 have to be executed for each satellite observation.

 Atmospheric Radiative Transfer Component:

The reflected and transmitted radiation are computed for a plane-parallel,
vertically inhomogeneous, scattering and absorbing atmosphere in five
spectral intervals (0.2-0.4, 0.4-0.5, 0.5-0.6, 0.6-0.7, 0.7-4.0 micrometer)
using the delta-Eddington approximation of radiative transfer. The
rationale for the selection of the delta-Eddington approach, and the
accuracy of this method are discussed in Pinker and Ewing (1985).  The
atmospheric radiative transfer model accounts for 1) absorption by ozone
and water vapor; 2) multiple scattering by molecules; 3) multiple
scattering and absorption by aerosols and cloud droplets and 4) multiple
reflection between the atmosphere and the surface.  It has five or six
layers, depending on the aerosol profile considered, and on whether a
cloud is present.  The parameterizations used in the atmospheric radiative
transfer model will be described in what follows.

Ozone and Water Vapor Absorption:

Scattering of radiation is weak at high altitudes where much of the
absorption by ozone takes place.  It is therefore assumed that ozone is
concentrated in a single, pure absorbing layer at the top of the atmosphere.
The fraction of the incident solar radiation absorbed by ozone in this layer
(A), is computed following Lacis and Hansen (1974):

(1)

where THETA0 is the solar zenith angle, R(THETA0) is the reflectivity of
the atmosphere-surface system below the absorbing ozone layer, and x is
the relative optical ozone pathlength.  The first term represents the absorp-
tion of the downwelling direct radiation, while the second one gives the
absorption of the upwelling diffuse radiation.  Ozone absorption is
accounted for in the 0.2-0.4 micrometer (UV) and in the 0.5-0.6 microme-
ter (VIS) spectral intervals (Lacis and Hansen, 1974):

(2)

(3)

The absorption by water vapor, Awv, in the 0.7-4.0 micrometer band is
computed in terms of the discrete probability distribution (p(kn)) of the
absorption coefficients (kn) following Lacis and Hansen (1974):

(4)

Here Yl is the effective water vapor amount (temperature and pressure
scaled amount) in the Lth atmospheric layer.  The total amount of ozone
and the effective water vapor amount in each layer of the atmosphere were
obtained from detailed data on ozone and water vapor densities,
temperature and pressure at 31 levels of the Standard Atmospheres
(tropical, mid-latitude summer and winter, subarctic summer and winter)
(Kneizys et al., 1980).

Rayleigh Scattering:

Molecular scattering is accounted for in the first four spectral intervals
0.2-0.4; 0.4-0.5; 0.5-0.6; and 0.6-0.7 micrometer.  For Rayleigh scattering
OMEGA = 1 and g = 0.  The Rayleigh scattering optical depth of a layer,
dTAU, between levels L and L-1 (Penndorf, 1957) is expressed as:

(5)

where:   z(L), z(L-1) - heights (km) at levels L and L-1   p(L), p(L-1) -
pressures (mb) at levels L and L-1   r - relative humidity in the layer   t - a
function of wavelength, depolarization factor and the refractive index of
the air.

Equation (5) includes corrections for humidity and the variation of gravi-
tation with altitude.  For the four spectral intervals between 0.2-0.7
micrometer, the parameter t was computed with the ATRAD model (Wis-
combe et al., 1984).

Aerosol Extinction:

Four atmospheric aerosol profiles (MAR-I, MAR-II, CONT-I and CONT-
II) of the Standard Radiation Atmosphere (SRA) (WCP-55, 1983) have
been incorporated into the solar model.  They depict typical maritime
conditions, dust outbreaks over oceans, average rural-continental aerosol
atmosphere and desert atmosphere under conditions of heavy haze,
respectively.  Depending on the aerosol profile selected, the atmosphere is
divided into five (CONT-I, CONT-II and MAR-I) or six (MAR-II) layers.
For each layer, the aerosol models give the extinction coefficients,
SIGMALAMBDA, single scattering albedos, OMEGA, and asymmetry
parameters, gLAMBDA, as functions of wavelength, LAMBDA, and
aerosol type (continental, maritime, background stratospheric and upper
atmospheric).



Cloud Extinction:

The cloud parameterization of Stephens et al. (1984) for two broad
spectral intervals in the shortwave region (0.2-0.75 micrometer and 0.75-
4.0 micrometer) was adopted.  It is expressed in terms of optical thickness,
TAU, single scattering albedo, OMEGA, and backscattered fraction of
monodirectional incident radiation BETA(MU0), as a function of the
cosine of the solar zenith angle, MU0.  In the solar model the radiative
transfer is treated in the framework of the delta-Eddington approximation;
the optical properties are described by the optical depth, TAU, the single
scattering albedo, OMEGA, and the asymmetry parameter, g.  In order to
implement the cloud parameterization of Stephens into the delta-
Eddington scheme, it is necessary to relate BETA(MU0) to g.

The single scattering albedos and the asymmetry parameters to be used in
the delta-Eddington approximation have been derived iteratively so that
they yield reflectance, R, and absorption, A, of clouds as given by the
Stephens' parameterization scheme.  This method allows the inclusion of
aerosols in the atmospheric column.  The parameterization of Stephens
does not account for aerosol extinction.  Because it was assumed by
Stephens that the cloud does not absorb in the visible spectrum, the ability
to include aerosol extinction is important.  In all the radiative transfer
computations, the spectral interval was (0.2-4.0 micrometer), to be
compatible with the parameterization of Stephens.

Surface Reflectivity:

The ocean- and land-albedo models of Briegleb et al., (1986) were
adopted to prescribe the surface reflectance as a function of solar zenith
angle, THETA0, and wavelength, LAMBDA.  In the land-albedo models
each surface is considered to consist of two components (ak, where k =
1,2) with fractions f and (1-f):

(6)

The albedo of each component is given as a function of the solar zenith
angle, the albedo for THETA0 = 60 degrees, a0, and an empirical
parameter, (dk, where k = 1,2), (Dickinson, 1983):

(7)

In the surface albedo models a0 is specified for 4 spectral intervals in the
shortwave band with boundaries at 0.2, 0.5, 0.7, 0.85 and 4.0 micrometer,
as well as the values of dk and the fractions f for each component.  The
above parameters and the surface reflectivities based on surface and
aircraft measurements are specified for ten surface types (Briegleb et al.,
1986).  It is assumed that land surface albedos are the same for both the
direct and the diffuse components of the solar irradiance.

The ocean-albedo for direct solar radiation is obtained from the following
expression (Briegleb et al., 1986):

adir(THETA0) = (2.6/((((cos(THETA0))**1.7)+0.065))
	+(15(cos(THETA0)-0.1)*(cos(THETA0)-0.5)
	*(cos(THETA0)-1))        (8)

For diffuse irradiance, a constant albedo value, adif, of 6% is used.

A surface albedo is derived from the satellite measurements at clear sky,
using the actual values of ozone and water vapor amounts and aerosol
climatology.  This value is then used as a scaling factor.  This scaling
procedure retains the spectral and angular characteristics of the surface
model of Briegleb et al. (1986), but yields a broadband albedo which is
consistent with satellite observations.  This procedure will accommodate
future developments of global scale surface reflectance models, as might
result from the EOS mission.

Further details about the model and its implementation can be found in
Pinker and Laszlo (1992).

Description of Staylor Method:

The algorithm was developed at NASA LANGLEY RESEARCH
CENTER by W. F. Staylor who supplied this ASCII-character
documentation.  It is an empirical/physical model that utilizes ISCCP-C1
data (Schiffer and Rossow, 1983) as its primary input data.  The model is
a modified version of an earlier model by Darnell et al. (1988), hereafter
D88, that utilized TOVS meteorological data (Smith et al., 1979) and Heat
Budget Product radiance data (Gruber, 1978) as input data to estimate
surface insolation.

The current insolation model uses a broadband shortwave approach which
assumes that insolation at the surface for all-sky conditions (clear and
cloudy), ISASi, can be related as the product of insolation at the top of the
atmosphere, ITOAi, clear-sky atmospheric transmittance, TA, and cloud
transmittance, TC,

	ISASi = ITOAi*TA*TC .   (1)

This is an instantaneous expression (i) and it is assumed that TA and TC
are independent.  ITOAi is given by

	ITOAi = S*cos(theta)    (2)

where S is the Earth-Sun distance-corrected solar flux and theta is the
solar zenith angle.

Atmospheric transmittance can be expressed as:

	TA = (1+0.065*PS*AS+2*J*AS)*exp(-TAU,theta)     (3)

where PS is the surface pressure, AS is surface albedo, J is an aerosol
parameter, and TAU,theta is the effective clear-sky atmospheric optical
depth. The first term in brackets relates the atmospheric backscattering of
surface reflected flux (treated as negative optical depth in D88).  The
0.065 coefficient is the average of values given by Lacis and Hansen
(1974) and Hoyt (1978).  Surface albedo will be treated later (see
SURFACE ALBEDO).  In Fig. 2 of D88, it was found that TAU,theta and
the optical depth at zero degrees solar zenith angle, TAU,zero, were
related as:

	TAU,theta = TAU,zero*(sec(theta))**N    (4)

and the power, N, could be calculated as:

	N = 2.1*(log(TAU,70.5 deg)-log(TAU,0 deg)).     (5)

Vertical optical depth (theta = 0 degrees) is defined as:

	TAU,zero = -ln(1-ALPHA,zero)    (6)

where ALPHA,zero is the effective downward attenuation factor for solar
energy due to all absorption and scattering processes (clear-sky only).
ALPHA,zero is the summation of six components given as:



ALPHA,zero = ALPHA,WV + ALPHA,OZ + ALPHA,02
	+ALPHA,CO2 +ALPHA,RAY + ALPHA,AER        (7)

Lacis and Hansen (1974) gave equations for the broadband absorptions of
water vapor and ozone which are approximated here as:

	ALPHA,WV = 0.100*(WV)**0.27     (8)

and

	ALPHA,OZ = 0.037*(OZ)**0.43      (9)

Yamamoto (1962) gave equations for the broadband absorptions of
oxygen and carbon dioxide which are approximated here as:

	ALPHA,O2 = 0.002*(PS)**0.87     (10)

and

	ALPHA,CO2 = 0.006*(PS)**0.29    (11)

Rayleigh attenuation was estimated by Lacis and Hansen (1974) as:

	ALPHA,RAY = 0.035*PS    (12)

Aerosol attenuation was based on WCP models (WCRP, 1983) given here
as:

	ALPHA,AER = J/2 + K     (13)

The J term is equal to aerosol optical depth times the quantity one minus
the asymmetry factor and K is equal to the optical depth times the quantity
one minus the single-scattering albedo.  Values for J and K are given in
Table 1 for five surface types.

It should be noted that the Rayleigh and aerosol attenuation terms are
concerned only with backscattering and/or absorption, but not with
forward scattering of flux which reaches the surface.

With values of S, PS, AS, WV, OZ, J, K, and TC (see INPUT DATA), one
could compute the instantaneous insolation at the surface as a function of
theta using equations (1) through (13).  Computation of the daily
insolation (d) involves the time integration of the instantaneous insolation
(i) from sunrise (sr) to sunset (ss) which can be approximated as:

ISASd = S*TC*(1 + 0.065*PS*AS+2*J*AS)
	*integral(exp(-TAU,theta)*cos(theta)*dt)
	  taken over sr to ss   (14)

where PS, AS, S, J, and TC are assumed to be constant for a region during
the course of each day.  Equation (14) can be evaluated as:

ISASd = S*H*TC*(1 + 0.065*PS*AS+2*J*AS)
	*exp(-TAU,zero*(UE)**-N)        (15)

where H is the daily vertical Sun fraction and UE is the effective daily
cosine of the solar zenith angle.  Both H and UE are defined in Table 2.

Cloud transmittance is based on a threshold technique (D88, Fig. 7) given
by:

	TC = 0.O5 +0.95*(Ro-Rm)/(Ro-Rc) (16)

where Ro, Rc and Rm are the TOA reflectances for overcast, clear-sky and
measured conditions, respectively.  The coefficients 0.05 and 0.95 (rather
than 0 and 1) simply relate the observation that for totally overcast days
(Rm=Ro) cloud transmittance is about 5 percent, not zero.  Each of the
three reflectance terms in equation (16) is a daily value obtained by
weighting the ISCCP 3-hourly instantaneous values with the cosine of the
solar zenith angle, UO.  The measured value, for instance, would be

	Rm = summation Rmi*UO/summation UO      (17)

Instantaneous overcast reflectances are estimated from a model by Staylor
(1985) as:

Roi = D1/(UO*UV) + (D2/(UO*UV))*((UO*UV)
	/(UO + UV))**2  (18)

where UV is the cosine of the viewing zenith angle and D1 and D2 are
ISCCP satellite coefficients given in Table 3.  These coefficients are
determined from ISCCP data from a number of non-snow, totally overcast
regions with mean cloud optical depths greater than 80 for each satellite
every month.  A linear regression of (Roi*UO*UV) versus
(((UO*UV)**2)/((UO + UV)**2)) is performed to determine D1 and D2.

Clear-sky reflectances are determined by one of several methods
depending on the surface type and snow cover.  For ocean regions, which
cover the majority of the Earth's surface,

	Rci = D3 + D4*((UO*UV)**-0.75)  (19)

where D3 and D4 are ISCCP satellite coefficients, given in Table 3, that
were determined from a number of totally-clear ocean regions for each
satellite every month.  A linear regression of (Rci) versus ((UO*UV)**-
0.75) is performed to determine D3 and D4.  For land regions where there
is no snow or where the snow cover does not change by more than 10%
during the month, daily Rc values are computed from the clear-sky pixels
and the minimum value for the month is used for the entire month.  If the
snow cover changes more than 10% during the month (determined for 5-
day intervals), the above procedure is still used, but is applied to several
shorter time intervals.

Measured instantaneous reflectances,  Rmi, are the pixel-weighted
average of the clear and cloud pixel reflectances which are then UO-
weighted to produce the daily Rm values (equation 17).  If only a single
Rmi value exists for a day (average of about four for the ISCCP
geostationary satellites), a value of Rm can be computed for that day.  But
if no Rmi value exists for a day (occurs most frequently in regions of polar
satellite coverage), a fill value is provided by one of two methods.  If an
Rm value exists for an adjacent longitudinal region for that day, it is used.
If it does not exist, the previous day's value of Rm is used.  This procedure
is expanded spatially, then temporally until a non-fill value of Rm is
found.

 Surface Albedo:

A daily surface albedo value for all-sky conditions, AS, is needed for the
computation of insolation (equation 15), and it is also used in the
computation of surface absorbed insolation which is given by:

	IAASd = ISASd*(1-AS)    (20)

The all-sky albedo is estimated as

	AS = Aso + (Asc - Aso)*(TC)**2  (21)

where Aso is the daily overcast albedo and Asc is the daily clear-sky
albedo. Because of the difficulty of obtaining consistent surface albedos
using the visible (0.5 - 0.7 micron: GOES, GMS, NOAA) and near-
infrared (0.7 - 1.1 micron; METEOSAT) radiances from ISCCP, daily
clear-sky albedo results from Staylor and Wilber (1990) were used which
were based on broadband ERBE scanner data.  Daily overcast albedos are
estimated to be equal to the instantaneous clear-sky albedos for a solar
zenith angle of 53 degrees (cosine = 0.6) as that is approximately the
effective downward zenith angle of diffuse rays from clouds.  For oceans,

	Aso = 0.065,    (22a)

and for land

	Aso = 1.1*Asc*(UE)**0.2         (22b)



Input Data

ISCCP datasets contain data bytes (B) for 132 parameters which are given
once every 3 hours (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 GMT).  Surface pressure is
given in millibars (1000 mb = sea level pressure) and is converted to
atmospheres as

	PS = B114/1000  (23)

Precipitable water vapor is given in centimeters for each of 5 layers and
converted to total burden in precipitable centimeters as

	WV = B127 + B128 + B129 + B130 + B131   (24)

Ozone is given in Dobson units and converted to atmosphere-cm as

	OZ = B132/1000  (25)

The cosine of the solar zenith angle, UO, is B14/100 and the cosine of the
viewing zenith angle, UV, is B15/100.  Snow coverage in percent is B13.
Total number of pixels in a region is B5, and the number of those which
are cloudy is B6.  Mean scaled reflectance (Rmi*UO) for the cloudy
pixels is B104, and mean scaled reflectance for the clear pixels is B107.

Solar declinations and Earth-Sun distances were obtained from the Naval
Observatory Almanac for each day.  A solar flux of 1365 W/m2 was used
for an Earth-Sun distance of 1AU.  As mentioned previously, surface
albedos were derived from ERBE scanner data (Staylor and Wilber,
1990).

has been checked to validate results against output provided by the Pinker
and Staylor research groups.

6.2     Confidence Level/Accuracy Judgement

ISCCP

ISCCP performs an absolute calibration of the polar orbiter instrument
with an uncertainty of less than 7 percent (see WMO/TD-No. 266,
Revised March 1991, pp 25).  ISCCP also normalizes the visible-
wavelength channel of each geostationary satellite to that of the NOAA
polar orbiter to within plus or minus 5 percent (see WMO.TD-No. 266,
Revised March 1991, pp 25).  After normalization, the polar orbiter
absolute calibration is transferred to each geostationary satellite.
Both the Staylor and Pinker methods have satisfied the ICRCCM Model-
Validation Tests using standard atmospheric profiles.  For this SRB
application, they use ISCCP scaled-radiance, cloud, precipitable water,
and ozone parameters, as well as some ERBE data for input.  The Pinker
Algorithm assumes accurate satellite calibration by ISCCP.   The Staylor
Algorithm uses a relative threshold technique and is somewhat insensitive
to satellite calibration errors.

GEBA

Caution is required when comparing cell-averaged, ground-truth values
with satellite estimates.  Of the ISCCP cells which contain GEBA
SUBSET sites, approximately 75 percent contain only one GEBA site per
ISCCP cell.  In such a case, an intercomparison of satellite results with
ground-truth values assumes that the fluxes averaged over a month over
the entire cell is the same as the monthly average of the fluxes over the
ground truth site.  That may not be true if either the meteorology or solar
exposure varies over the cell.  Thus, even a GEBA category 88 site in
near-flat topography may still not be representative of an ISCCP cell if it
is in a polluted, obstructed, or frequently-foggy area relative to the rest of
the cell.  In some cases (much of Europe and a few other locations), there
are multiple ground sites per ISCCP cell, and the cell-averaged ground
truth values can be used with more confidence.  Another issue is that
satellite estimates are based on the solar radiation between 0.2-4.0
(Pinker) or 0.2-5.0 (Staylor) micrometers.  The ground truth
measurements are for the wavelength interval of 0.3-3.0 micrometers.
This spectral mismatch means that satellite-estimated downward
irradiance should be approximately one percent higher than ground
measurements on a clear day.  On an overcast day with a cloud optical
depth = 10, the differences due to spectral mismatch is less than 0.02
percent based on high- resolutions spectral calculations supplied by the
UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND. Thus, there could be positive bias
between 0 and 1 percent (depending on monthly-averaged cloud cover)
when satellite estimates of downward irradiance are compared with
ground truth.

6.3     Usage Guidance

The SRB product is intended to provide users a time series of radiation
budget parameters for the period spanning July 1983 through 1995.

12.0    SUMMARY

This is Version 1.0 of a new interim product with parameters obtained
from a variety of sources.  As such, it is expected that revisions will be
necessary as corrections are received from various users.  The general
approach is to use the ISCCP C1 data supplemented by the ERBE results
as input to SRB satellite algorithms to estimate various surface
parameters.  Where possible, the satellite-estimated fluxes are compared
with surface-measured ground truth.  Using the ISCCP 3-hourly
parameters as input, SRB results were generated using two different
algorithms.  The two methods use different approaches.  Both methods
apply spectral and angular corrections (based on ERB and ERBE results)
which are not included in the original ISCCP C1 data.  The user may have
increased confidence in the SRB results for those cells wherein the two
methods obtain values that differ slightly.  The Pinker Algorithm
(developed jointly by Drs. R. T. Pinker and I. Laszlo from the University
of Maryland) is a physical model which uses an iterative procedure based
on delta-Eddington radiative transfer calculations.  The Staylor algorithm
(developed by Mr. W. F. Staylor from the NASA Langley Research
Center) is a parameterized physical model in which both cloud and aerosol
transmission characteristics have been separately tuned to historic data at
various locations around the globe.  The monthly-averaged radiative
fluxes are based on the monthly average of 24-hr daily averages, but
certain other items are simple linear averages of values during daylight
hours.

Refer to the srb_yymm.doc file for further information.

13.0 NOTES



SATELLITE DATA GAPS

On a given day, time, and location, one or more parameters may be
missing from either the ISCCP C1 or ERBE data used as inputs to the SRB
algorithms.  ISCCP missing data is caused by gaps in the operational satellite
data being used to create the C1 product.  Both the Pinker and Staylor
algorithms use automated gap-filling techniques to compensate for voids in
either the ISCCP or ERBE input data.  Each algorithm uses a different
technique which may cause notable differences between the two algorithms for
one or more of the output parameters.  (Details concerning the gap-filling
techniques for each algorithm can be found in listings of the Fortran code
supplied with each month's SRB data package.)  These large differences occur
infrequently and should not be of general concern.  The user should be alert
to the possibility of their existence, however.  Whenever a parameter seems
"out-of-line" with historical values, exceeds expected max or min values, or
is significantly different from results of the other algorithm, it is
recommended that the user examine other supporting parameters in the monthly
file to determine the cause of the erratic behavior.  Monthly-file parameters
9 through 22 and 42 through 50 should be useful.  Examination of the daily
files for the month may also be useful.  If a cause for the abnormal value
cannot be found or supported by other results from literature, the most likely
problem is a combination of data gaps which cannot be properly handled by the
automated procedures.  In such a case, that value should be considered as
missing data.  Automated procedures are seldom successful in accounting for
all possible combinations of data gaps or errors in input data.


REPROCESSING OF DATA MONTHS

September 1988 and November 1988 have been reprocessed due to
errors found in an input file for the Staylor algorithm. Only
parameters that have Staylor output have been affected.
September 1988 was reprocessed on September 17, 1993, and
November 1988 was reprocessed on November 22, 1993.
The SRB version number now listed in the README files for these
months is 1.1.r1.  Users should obtain this new release for these
two months.  The new release is consistent with Version 1.1 for
all other data months.


RECREATION OF HDF FILES

All of the monthly and daily HDF files from March 1985 through
December 1988 (excluding the quarterly months - January, April,
July and October) have been recreated to correct an error found
in the listing of the processing date. The processing date month
was listed as "00". This revision, Version 1.1.r2 updates the
processing date of these data months to that listed in the
respective README file originally released. For simplicity, all
of the HDF file versions have been changed to 1.1.r2, including
the quarterly months. Please note that the information contained
in parameters 1 through 51 for the monthly files, and parameters
1 through 9 for the daily files, has not been changed. If the user
does not have a need for the processing date as part of the HDF
file, then it is not necessary to obtain Version 1.1.r2 for these
months.
