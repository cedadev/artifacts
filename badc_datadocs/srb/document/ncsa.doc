FTP INSTRUCTIONS

Most NCSA Software is released into the public domain.  That is, for these programs,
the  public domain has all rights for future licensing, resale, and publication of
available packages. If you are connected to Internet (NSFNET, ARPANET, MILNET,
etc.) you may download NCSA software and documentation and source code if it is
available, at no charge from the anonymous file transfer protocol (FTP) server at
NCSA where you got this file. The procedure you should follow to do so is presented
below. If you have any questions regarding this procedure or whether you are
connected to Internet, consult your local system administration or network expert.

1. Log on to a host at your site that is connected to the Internet and is running
software supporting the FTP command.

2. Invoke FTP on most systems by entering the Internet address of the server. Type
the following at the shell (usually "%") prompt:

      % ftp ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu

    or

       % ftp 141.142.20.50


3. Log in by entering anonymous for the name.

4. Enter your local email address (login@host) for the password.

5. Enter the following at the "ftp>" prompt to copy a file from the server to your
local host:

      ftp> get filename

where "filename" is the name of the file you want a copy of.  For example, to get
a copy of this file from the server enter:

      ftp> get README.FIRST

   To get a copy of our software brochure, enter:

      ftp> get README.BROCHURE


NOTE:  Some of the filenames on the server are rather long to aid in
identification.  Some operating systems may have problems with names this long.  To
change the name the file will have on your local machine type the following at the
"ftp>" prompt ("remoteName" is the name of the file on the server and "localName"
is the name you want the file to have on your local machine):

      ftp> get remoteName localName

      Example:

      ftp> get README.BROCHURE README.BRO

6. For files that are not text files (almost everything else) you will need to
specify that you want to transfer binary files.  Do this by typing the following
at the "ftp>" prompt:

      ftp> type binary

   You can now use the "get" command to download binary files.  To switch back to
ASCII text transfers type:

      ftp> type ascii

7. The "ls" and "cd" commands can be used at the "ftp>" prompt to list and change
directories as in the shell.

8. Enter "quit" to exit FTP and return to your local host.


FTP SOFTWARE BY MAIL

A tape archive of the FTP server may also be obtained from NCSA if your site does
not support FTP, or is not connected to the Internet.  The tapes are available in
the following formats:


  8mm Exabyte tape
  DC600 cartridge tape
  1600 bpi 9-track reel tape
  6250 bpi 9-track reel tape


To obtain an order form, send your request to the following address:

  FTP Archive Tapes

VIRUS INFORMATION

The Software Tools Group here at NCSA is very virus-conscious. We routinely check
our machines for viruses and recommend that you do so also. For the Macintosh we
use Disinfectant. You can obtain a copy of Disinfectant from the Mac directory.

All Mac files on the server that were created by the Software Tools Group have been
checked for viruses with Disinfectant.  Software in "Mac/contributions" directory
is NOT checked for viruses.  Be sure to check any software downloaded from the "Mac/
contributions" directory before using it.


GENERAL INFORMATION



DIRECTORY STRUCTURE

The FTP server is organized as specified below:


    /Mac        Macintosh software
    /PC         IBM PC software
    /UNIX       Software for machines running UNIX or equivalent OS
    /SGI                Software that primarily runs on Silicon Graphics
			machines only
    /HDF                Hierarchical Data Format applications and tools
    /Collab     Collaborative software tools
    /Samples    Samples that can be used with most of NCSA software
			tools
    /Documentation    Currently being constructed, check each application's
			directory for documentation
    /ncsapubs         Information produced by the Publications group,
		      including Metacenter announcements, data linke & access,
		      a software listing, start-up guides, and other
		      reference documents.
    /misc       Miscellaneous documentation and software
    /incoming   directory for contributions
    /outgoing           swap directory

Information for a particular application can be found in the README file, located
in the same directory as the application.  The README files contain information on
new features, known bugs, compile information, and other important notes.



All directories on the FTP server contain an INDEX file.  These files outline the
hierarchical structure of the directory and (recursively) all files and directories
contained within it.  The INDEX at the root level contains the structure of the
entire server listing all files and directories on it.  The INDEX file in each
software directory contains additional information about each file.  The letter in
parenthesis after the file name indicates how the file should be downloaded:  ascii
(a), binary (b), or mac binary (m).



The "misc" directories found in some software tool directories contain
supplementary code or other information.  Refer to the README file in that directory
for a description of what is contained within the "misc" directory.



The "contrib" directories contain contributed software.  This directory usually
contains NCSA source that has been modified by people outside of NCSA as well as
binaries compiled on different platforms not available to the Software Tools Group.
If you have modified NCSA software or would like to share some code please contact
the developer of the source so arrangements can be made to upload it to the
"incoming"  directory.  If you are downloading software from the "contrib" directory
please note that this software is not supported by NCSA and has not been checked
for viruses (see statement on viruses above).  NCSA may not be held responsible for
anything resulting from use of the contributed software.  *** RUN AT YOUR OWN RISK
***

FILE NAMES



All file names consist of the name of the tool, the version number, and one or more
extensions.  The extensions identify what type of information is contained in the
file, and what format it is in.  For example, here is a list of files in the /Mac/
DataScope directory:

   DataScope2.0.1.asc.tar.Z
   DataScope2.0.1.src.sit.hqx
   DataScope2.0.1.smp.sit.hqx
   DataScope2.0.1.mac.sit.hqx
   DataScope2.0.1.msw.sit.hqx


The first three character extension indicates what type of data can be found in
that file (ASCII documentation, source, samples, etc.).  The other extensions
indicate what format the files are in.  The extensions ".tar" and ".sit" indicate
types of archives, and the ".Z" and ".hqx" indicate compression and encoding
schemes.  (See below for instructions on extracting files that have been archived
and/or compressed.)  Following are a list of extensions and their meanings:


    .sn3   Sun 3 executables
    .sn4   Sun 4 executables
    .386   Sun 386i executables
    .sgi   Silicon Graphics Iris executables
    .dgl   Silicon Graphics Iris using DGL executables
    .rs6   IBM RS6000 executables
    .cv2   Convex 2 executables
    .cv3   Convex 3 executables
    .cr2   Cray 2 executables
    .crY   CrayYMP executables
    .d31   DEC 3100 executables
    .m88   Motorola 88k executables
    .m68   Motorola 68k executables
    .exe   IBM PC executables
    .mac   Macintosh executables
    .src   source code
    .smp   sample files
    .asc   ASCII text documentation
    .msw   Microsoft Word documentation
    .ps    postscript documentation
    .man   formatted man page
    .shar  Bourne shell archive
    .sit   archive created by Macintosh application, StuffIt
    .hqx   encoded with Macintosh application, BinHex
    .sea   Self extracting Macintosh archive
    .tar   archive created with UNIX tar command
    .Z     compressed with UNIX compress command


The files in the PC directory are the only exception to this naming convention. In
order to conform with the DOS convention of eight character file names and one,
three character extension, the names for PC files are slightly different. Whenever
possible the scheme outlined above is used, but the names are usually abbreviated
and all but one of the dots "." have been omitted.



EXTRACTING ARCHIVED FILES


INSTRUCTIONS FOR MACINTOSH FILES

If a file ends with the extension ".sit" it must be unstuffed with either the
shareware program StuffIt or the Public Domain program UnStuffIt.  Files ending
with the ".hqx" must be decoded with BinHex.  These programs can be found on the
FTP server in the /Mac/Utilities directory.  Note that the BinHex program must be
downloaded with MacBinary enabled, and the StuffIt program must be decoded before
it can be used.  Files downloaded from the server may be both Stuffed (".sit"
extension) and BinHexed (".hqx" extension).  These files must be first decoded and
then unstuffed.


To decode a file with the ".hqx" extension (a BinHexed file):


    1. Download the file to your Macintosh.
    2. Start the application BinHex by double-clicking on it.
    3. From the "File" menu in BinHex, choose "UpLoad -> Application".
    4. Choose the ".hqx" file to be decoded and select "Open".
    5. The suggested file name will appear in a dialog box.
    6. Select "Save" to decode the file.


To uncompress a file with the ".sit" extension (a Stuffed file):


    1. Download the file to your Macintosh.
    2. Start the application Stuffit by double-clicking on it.
    3. From the "File" menu in Stuffit, choose "Open Archive...".
    4. Choose the ".sit" file to be unstuffed and select "Open".  A window with all
       the files contained in the stuffed file will appear.
    5. Choose "Select All" in the "Edit" menu to select all of the files.
    6. Click on the "Extract" box at the bottom of the window.
    7. Select "Save All" in the dialog box to save all the selected files in the
       current directory.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR PC FILES


Most IBM PC files are archived and compressed using the pkzip utility. (If you do
not have the pkzip utility on your PC, you may obtain it from the FTP server by
anonymous ftp.  The file you need is called pkz110.exe and it is located in /PC/
Telnet/contributions.  Set the ftp mode to binary and "get" the file pkz110.exe.
Then, on your PC, run PKZ110.EXE with no arguments and several files will be self-
extracted, including one called PKUNZIP.EXE.  It may then be convenient to copy
PKUNZIP.EXE to the directory where you have placed, or are going to place, your
Telnet files.) To extract these files, first download the file with the ".zip"
extension to your PC and then type the following at the DOS prompt:


   > pkunzip -d filename.zip

where "filename" is the name of the file you want to unarchive.



INSTRUCTIONS FOR UNIX FILES

Most files on the FTP server will be both tarred and compressed.  For more
information on the "tar" and "compress" commands you can type "man tar" and "man
compress" at your shell prompt to see the online manual page for these commands,
or ask your system administrator for help.  You should first uncompress and then
unarchive files ending in ".tar.Z" with the following procedure.

Files with the ".Z" extension have been compressed with the UNIX "compress" command.
To uncompress these files type the following at the shell prompt:

   % uncompress filename.Z


where "filename.Z" is the name of the file ending with the ".Z" extension that you
wish to uncompress.


Files with the ".tar" extension have been archived with the UNIX "tar" command. To
extract the files type the following at the shell prompt:


   % tar xvf filename.tar


Some files are archived using a shell archive utility and are indicated as such
with the ".shar" extension.  To extract the files type the following at the shell
prompt:

   % sh filename.shar


DOCUMENTATION


NCSA offers users several documentation formats for its programs including ASCII
text, Microsoft Word, and postscript.  If one of these formats does not fit your
needs, documentation can be obtained through the mail at the following address:


Documentation Orders

152 Computing Applications Building
605 East Springfield Avenue
Champaign, IL  61820

or call:

Debbie Shirley at (217) 244-4130


Members of the Software Tools Group within NCSA are currently working on videotapes
that demonstrate and also offer tutorials for NCSA programs. A note will be posted
here when these tapes are available for distribution.



ASCII FORMAT


ASCII text files are provided for all software and are indicated with the ".asc"
extension.  Helpful figures and diagrams obviously cannot be included in this form
of documentation.  We suggest you use the other forms of documentation if possible.



MICROSOFT WORD FORMAT


If you are a Macintosh user, please download documents with the ".msw" extension.
These files should also be stuffed and BinHexed (information on extracting these
files from the archive is contained earlier in this file). The documents can be
previewed and printed using the Microsoft Word application.  Word documents contain
text, images, and formatting.



POSTSCRIPT FORMAT

If you are a UNIX user and/or have access to a postscript printer, please download
files with the ".pos" extension.  The documents can be previewed using a postscript
previewer or can be printed directly to a postscript printer using a command like
"lpr".


BUG REPORTS AND SUPPORT

The Software Tools Group at NCSA is very interested in how the software tools
developed here are being used. Please send any comments or suggestions you may have
to the appropriate address.

NOTE: This is a new kind of shareware. You share your science and successes with
us, and we can get more resources to share more NCSA software with you.

If you want to see more NCSA software, please send us a letter, email or US Mail,
telling us what you are doing with our software. We need to know:


	(1) What science you are working on - an abstract of your
	    work would be fine.

	(2) How NCSA software has helped you, for example, by increasing
	    your productivity or allowing you to do things you could
	    not do before.


We encourage you to cite the use of any NCSA software you have used in your
publications. A bibliography of your work would be extremely helpful.
