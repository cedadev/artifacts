First WCRP Surface Radiation Budget Global 
Data Sets

Shortwave Radiation Parameters

Introduction

This CD-ROM contains Version 1.1 Surface Radiation Budget (SRB) 
shortwave products for the period March 1985 through December 1988 
as produced by the World Climate Research Programme's (WCRP) SRB 
Satellite Data Analysis Center (SDAC).  Inputs to the Version 1.1 prod-
uct are results from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project 
(ISCCP) and the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE).   SDAC 
uses two methods (known as the Pinker and Staylor algorithms) to esti-
mate surface downward and net irradiances, surface albedo, downward 
direct/diffuse ratio, surface cloud forcing, and daylight cloud fraction.  In 
addition, various other radiation, cloud, meteorological and diagnostic 
parameters are provided to aid the user in understanding variations in the 
SRB parameters.  

The data are archived at the NASA Langley Research Center.  The pro-
duction  of this CD-ROM is a NASA-sponsored effort implemented by 
the staff of the Langley Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC).

The CD-ROM Contents

There are four major directories on this disk.

The DATA directory contains the following types of SRB data files.

o	MON_YYMM.HDF is a binary Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) 
file giving 52 monthly-average parameters for 6596 cells (280x280 
km) over the globe.

o	DAY_YYMM.HDF is a binary HDF file giving 10 daily-average 
parameters for 6596 cells over the globe.

The  IMAGES directory contains HDF and GIF images for each of the 
data months.

o	IMG_YYMM.HDF is a monthly graphics HDF file which may be 
used for browse purposes.   Each file contains 19 global images of 
various SRB, ISCCP, and  ERBE parameters. 

o	I##_YYMM.GIF is a GIF  file which may be used for browse pur-
poses.  Each file contains a single  global image of an SRB, ISCCP, 
or  ERBE parameter. 

The DOCUMENT directory contains documentation for each data 
month and general documentation for the disk.

o	SRB_YYMM.DOC is an ASCII README file containing informa-
tion on  that month's inputs, results of that month's calibration tests 
and ground-truth comparisons, definitions of SRB parameters, and a 
physical description of both the Pinker and Staylor algorithms.

The SOFTWARE directory contains programs which access the SRB 
data as well as the source code for the algorithms used to create the data.

o	PINKER.FOR is an ASCII file showing the FORTRAN listing of 
the Pinker algorithm.

o	STAYLOR.FOR is an ASCII file showing the FORTRAN listing of 
the Staylor algorithm.

o	RDSRBHDF.C and RDSRBHDF.F  are C and FORTRAN read 
routines to access the data files.

README files are located in every directory.   These files  help the user 
understand and use the data in the directory.

SRB Data Sets

Whitlock et al. (1993) (located in the file WHITLOCK.DOC in the DOC-
UMENT directory)  is recommended as a reference manual for use with 
the SRB data sets, however, the srb_yymm.doc files will suffice for many 
applications.  Sample results for a few selected regions of the globe are 
presented in DiPasquale and Whitlock (1993).

The user generally may have confidence in the SRB results when surface 
downward and net values for the Pinker and Staylor algorithms agree 
within 15 W/m**2.  Data for regions or times where larger differences 
occur should be viewed with caution.  ISCCP does not give scaled-radi-
ance values when solar zenith angles are greater than 72.8 degrees.  Also, 
the satellite bands used by ISCCP do not allow a clear definition of 
clouds over bright surfaces such as snow/ice and desert regions.  SRB 
results for near-dark or bright-surface conditions should be viewed with 
caution.  An unresolved issue in the Version 1.1 SRB data sets is broad-
band surface albedo.  Significant differences in surface albedo sometimes 
exist between the Pinker and  Staylor algorithms.

System Requirements

This CD-ROM has been formatted and produced to work with IBM PCs, 
Apple Macintoshes and Unix systems  with ISO-9660 CD-ROM driver 
support.   Also included in this package  are two 3.5"  floppy disks which 
contain access software for IBM PCs and Apple Macintoshes.   Installa-
tion instructions for the access software are on the label of each disk.  
Please note,  the filenames on some Unix systems may be interpreted 
with a period and a version number.  To use these filenames enclose the 
filename in double quotes; for example, more "README.;1".

HDF 

The SRB data and image files are stored in the Version 3.2r1 of the Hier-
archical Data Format (HDF) developed by the National Center for Super-
computing Applications.    The PC and MacIntosh access programs 
provide the tools needed to view the data and images on those platforms.  
Users on other systems should refer to the README.HDF file in the 
DOCUMENT directory on the CD-ROM for information on obtaining 
the HDF software from NCSA.
