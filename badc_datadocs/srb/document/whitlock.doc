                                 ABSTRACT



      Shortwave radiative fluxes which reach the Earth's surface are
      key elements that influence both atmospheric and oceanic
      circulation.  The World Climate Research Program has established
      the Surface Radiation Budget climatology project with the
      ultimate goal of determining the various components of the
      surface radiation budget from satellite data on a global scale.
      This report describes the first global product that is being
      produced and archived as part of that effort.  The interested
      user can obtain the monthly global data sets free of charge using
      email procedures.





1 INTRODUCTION



      Radiation fluxes reaching the Earth's surface are principal
      elements in the total energy exchange between the atmosphere and
      the land or ocean surfaces.  Surface radiation exchanges
      influence both atmospheric and oceanic circulations.  A Surface
      Radiation Budget (SRB) climatology project was established under
      the World Climate Research Program (WCRP) following
      recommendations from the international science community (Suttles
      and Ohring, 1986).  The goal was the determination of the various
      components of SRB globally from satellite observations.



      Since 1986, the WCRP/SRB project has tested a number of shortwave
      (SW) and longwave (LW) satellite algorithms with special field
      experiments and experimental global processing studies.  This
      testing has been coordinated with two international science
      groups--the SRB Science Working Group (SRB/SWG) and the WCRP
      Working Group on Radiation Fluxes (WCRP/WGRF).  A number of SW
      algorithms have been shown to be accurate within 10 W/m**2 under
      ideal conditions when satellites are accurately calibrated and no
      data gaps exist (Whitlock et al., 1990a).  Experimental global
      processing studies using data from the International Satellite
      Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) have shown that two SW
      algorithms have sufficiently accurate data gap filling procedures
      to warrant the production of long-term global data sets (World
      Climate Research Program, 1992, p. 6).  The first WCRP/SRB SW
      global data set (Version 1.1) is a quick-look, interim product
      for the period between March 1985 and November 1988.  This is a
      period where the ISCCP data used as input are considered most
      accurate.


      It is the purpose of this document to provide an in-depth
      technical description of the Version 1.1 WCRP/SRB SW global data
      set for potential users.  The information included is similar to
      that in a README file (named srb_readme_yymm) with each month's
      data package.  It should be emphasized that the srb_readme_yymm
      file may be quite different from month to month, depending on
      satellite calibration and ground-truth comparison results.  This
      document uses the July 1985 data month as an example to describe
      the SRB product.

2 CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR INTERIM SRB PROCESSING


      Using ISCCP 3-hourly parameters as primary input (Rossow et al.,
      1991), SRB results are generated using two different algorithms.
      The two methods use different approaches.  Both methods apply
      spectral and angular corrections (based on Nimbus-7 Earth
      Radiation Budget (ERB) and Earth Radiation Budget Experiment
      (ERBE) results) which are not included in the original ISCCP
      data. They also separate surface from aerosol effects, which is
      not included in ISCCP.  Each method uses its own cloud algorithm
      which has been compared with experimental data from a number of
      regions.  SDAC also compares basic SRB results with a limited
      amount of ground truth data that are available.  The user may
      have increased confidence in the SRB results for those cells
      wherein the two methods obtain values that differ only slightly.
      Caution is suggested for those cells where the two methods differ
      by a large amount.


      One algorithm was developed jointly by Drs. R. T. Pinker and I.
      Laszlo from the University of Maryland (hereafter referred to as
      the Pinker algorithm).  The Pinker algorithm is a physical model
      which uses an iterative procedure based on delta-Eddington
      radiative transfer calculations.  The other algorithm was
      developed by Mr. W. F. Staylor from the NASA Langley Research
      Center (the Staylor algorithm).  The Staylor algorithm is a
      parameterized physical model which uses ISCCP radiances, Tiros
      Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) meteorology, and
      climatological aerosols to determine the clear atmospheric and
      cloud transmission characteristics.  Both methods have been
      demonstrated to satisfy the Intercomparison of Radiation Codes in
      Climate Models (ICRCCM) model-validation tests using standard
      atmospheric profiles. For this SRB application, they use ISCCP
      scaled-radiance, cloud amount, precipitable water, and ozone
      parameters for input.  The Pinker algorithm assumes accurate
      satellite calibration by ISCCP.  The Staylor algorithm uses a
      relative threshold technique and is less sensitive to satellite
      calibration errors.  Details about both methods are given in
      Appendices A and B.

      The month is defined in terms of Greenwich time and dates.  Thus,
      the local-time beginning and ending of the month will vary with
      cell location.  SRB uses the same grid system as that used by
      ISCCP for its C1 products. The system is an equal-area grid with
      a cell size of approximately 280x280 km (Rossow et al., 1991).
      Monthly averaged radiative fluxes are based on an average of
      24-hour daily values.  Certain other items (defined in section 7)
      are simple linear averages of values during daylight hours.


3 ORGANIZATION OF THE SRB DATA PRODUCT

      The data product for each month consists of six files.  The
      following paragraphs give a general description of each file.


      The first file is the ASCII-format header file named
      srb_readme_yymm (srb_readme_8507, for example).  This README file
      contains a wide range of information about the data set as well
      as specific information about the particular month for which data
      were processed.  The following subjects are included:


            I.   GENERAL INFORMATION

            II.  CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR SRB PROCESSING

            III. SATELLITE CALIBRATION VALUES USED TO DERIVE SRB RESULTS

            IV.  COMPARISON OF SATELLITE-INFERRED SRB RESULTS WITH GROUND

                 TRUTH

            V.   DEFINITIONS OF SRB PARAMETERS AND CODES

                  A. DEFINITION OF 52 ITEMS IN MONTHLY BINARY FILE            

                     srb_monavgs_yymm (srb_monavgs_8507, for example)

                  B. DEFINITION OF 10 ITEMS IN DAILY BINARY FILE               

                     srb_dayavgs_yymm (srb_dayavgs_8507, for example)

                  C. DESCRIPTION OF BINARY HIERARCHICAL DATA FORMAT (HDF)

                     FILES

            VI.  DESCRIPTION OF PINKER METHOD

            VII. DESCRIPTION OF STAYLOR METHOD



      The second and third files are in ASCII format showing Fortran
      listings of the Pinker and Staylor algorithms (srb_pinker.for and
      srb_staylor.for, respectively).  These files are intended to show
      the programming logic, procedures, and numerical assumptions
      which may influence results.  They do not contain extraneous
      input files and cannot be compiled as Fortran code.



      The fourth and fifth files are binary data files in HDF format,
      Version 3.2r1.  The fourth file (srb_monavgs_yymm) contains
      monthly average values for 52 different items from several
      different sources.  In addition to SRB values, supplementary data
      are provided in order to understand causes and effects of
      variations in the SRB product.  The fifth file (srb_dayavgs_yymm)
      contains 24-hour daily average values for 10 key SRB items.



      The sixth file (srb_mon_img_yymm.hdf) is a graphics file which
      contains 19 global images in HDF format.  The intent is to allow
      the user to quickly browse the most important SRB parameters
      without the requirement to read the entire data set.



      The first, fourth, fifth, and sixth files change each month.



      When SRB data are distributed on a CD-ROM, file names are changed
      in order to accommodate IBM personal computer DOS format as
      follows:



            ARCHIVE FILE NAME                   CD-ROM FILE NAME

            *****************                   ****************

            srb_readme_yymm                     srb_yymm.doc
            srb_pinker.for                      pinker.for
            srb_staylor.for                     staylor.for
            srb_monavgs_yymm                    mon_yymm.hdf
            srb_dayavgs_yymm                    day_yymm.hdf
            srb_mon_img_yymm.hdf                img_yymm.hdf


When distribution is by email, the user may rename the archive file
names to his or her system requirements as he gets the individual files
from the archive.



    The convention used for version numbers of the SRB data set is as follows:


   1. A change in the output products will constitute a change in the
   integer part of the version number.  For example, increasing the
   number of parameters in the monthly file from 52 to 55 would cause a
   change from Version 1.0 to Version 2.0.



   2. A change in the method of computing a parameter or a set of
   parameters will constitute a change in the tenths part of the
   version number.  For example, a change in the Pinker algorithm
   caused the version number to increase from 1.0 to 1.1.


   3. Revisions made because of errors in the input data or data
   processing procedures will be labled r1, r2, etc. after the version
   number.  For example, reissue of a data month because of an updated
   ISCCP tape would cause the version to change from 1.1 to 1.1.r1.



All months with the same version number use the same algorithms and are
comparable to each other independent of their r number.


      The SRB shortwave data product is archived in the Earth Observing
      System Data Information System (EOSDIS) at the Langley
      Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC).  The primary means of
      transfer for the SRB data package will be by electronic TCP/IP
      and FTP procedures rather than the traditional mailing of data
      tapes.  Software for reading the HDF format files on various
      computers is available.  The above service is expected to be free
      of charge.  Other data transfer media are also available from the
      archive on request; however, there may be nominal costs.  To
      access the data set, users may contact the Langley DAAC User
      Services by telephone at (804) 864-8656 or by email at
      userserv@eosdis.larc.nasa.gov.

4 GENERAL INFORMATION



      A summary statement similar to that below is given in the README
      file each month.  This is to provide the user with data inputs
      and processing details particular to each data month.


        1. DATA DATE = JULY 1985

        2. PROCESSING DATE = OCTOBER 15, 1992

        3. SRB VERSION NUMBER = 1.1

        4. CHANGES SINCE LAST VERSION FOR THIS DATA DATE = Update to Pinker   
            algorithm to improve agreement with top-of-atmosphere ERBE         
            results. 

        5. ISCCP C1 VERSIONS USED AS INPUT (2 PER MONTH):

                  1st Half = Vol. ID Ver. 0

                  2nd Half = Vol. ID Ver. 0

        6. ERBE SATELLITES USED TO CONSTRUCT ERBE MONTHLY-AVERAGE VALUES =
            ERBS and NOAA-9.

        7. GENERAL COMMENTS: None for this month.




5 SATELLITE CALIBRATION VALUES USED TO DERIVE SRB RESULTS



       ISCCP performs an absolute calibration of the polar orbiter
       instrument with an uncertainty not exceeding 7 percent (Rossow
       et al., 1991, p. 25). Comparison of ISCCP calibration with other
       methods suggests that the above statement is valid during the
       NOAA-9 period (see Whitlock et al., 1990b).  ISCCP also
       normalizes each geostationary satellite visible- wavelength
       channel to that of the NOAA polar orbiter to be within plus or
       minus 5 percent relative to each other (Rossow et al., 1991, p.
       25).  The absolute calibration equations that result from the
       ISCCP calibration/normalization process are given in Rossow et
       al., 1992.



      SRB results depend on the accuracy of ISCCP reported radiances.
      The conversion of measured counts to radiance values depends on
      the accuracy of the satellite calibration equation for the
      particular instrument in use. Because of its critical importance,
      ISCCP satellite calibrations are tested each data month using
      both the Staylor and Pinker algorithms.



      Top-of-atmosphere (TOA) thick-cloud albedos can be compared for
      each satellite using Staylor's overcast reflectances (eqn (B18))
      converted to albedo using the satellite coefficients D1 and D2 as
      described in Appendix B. For a 45 degree solar-zenith angle,
      cloud albedo = (2.82843*D1) + (0.23725*D2).  Typical thick-cloud
      albedos are as follows:



                            DATA MONTH = JULY 1985



       TOP-OF-ATMOSPHERE THICK-CLOUD ALBEDO FROM THE STAYLOR ALGORITHM

                         (SOLAR ZENITH ANGLE = 45 DEG)



                        NOAA-9      GOES-6      METEOSAT-2        GMS-3

****************************************************************************

OVERCAST CLOUDS         0.796       0.807         0.806           0.816

(OPTICAL DEPTH > or = 80)

****************************************************************************


Ideally, the above values should be within 5 percent of each other in each data month.



      A further test is performed by comparing Pinker algorithm top-of-
      atmosphere (TOA) SW net flux (derived from ISCCP) with ERBE
      results over land for the globe between the latitudes of 55
      degrees North and 55 degrees South. Ocean cells are not used in
      the calibration comparison because of different treatments of Sun
      glint between the ISCCP and ERBE satellite data.


             BROADBAND TOA SW NET FLUX DIFFERENCES (PINKER-ERBE)

*****************************************************************************

                  1. DATA MONTH = JULY 1985



                  2. BIAS = +3 W/m**2



                  3. TOTAL RMS = 9 W/m**2

*****************************************************************************

      Note: Total RMS error includes bias error.


The absolute uncertainty of the ERBE data is approximately 5-6 W/
m**2 (Suttles et al., 1992).  Ideally, the bias values should be less than 10 W/
m**2 each data month.


      It must be emphasized that the above Pinker minus ERBE statistics
      do not apply for all cells over the globe.  Both ERBE all-sky and
      clear- sky TOA SW net irradiance values are included in the SRB
      data product as items 21 and 22 in the file srb_monavgs_yymm (see
      section 7).  Cell-by-cell Pinker minus ERBE differences are
      provided as items 49 and 50 in file srb_monavgs_yymm for those
      months when ERBE data are available.


6 COMPARISON OF SATELLITE-INFERRED SRB RESULTS WITH GROUND TRUTH


      Downward-measured SW fluxes for validation of the satellite-
      estimated SRB results were provided by Drs. A. Ohmura and H.
      Gilgen from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich, as
      part of their monthly average Global Energy Budget Archive
      (GEBA).  Only those sites which are most accurate (GEBA category
      88) have been used in this study.



      In the comparison of SRB results with ground truth, one should
      keep in mind that satellite estimates are computed in the
      intervals between 0.2-4.0 (Pinker) or 0.2-5.0 (Staylor)
      micrometers while ground truth measurements are for the
      wavelength interval of approximately 0.3-3.0 micrometers,
      depending on instrument manufacturer.  Therefore,
      satellite-estimated downward irradiance should be approximately
      1-percent higher than ground measurements on a clear day.  On an
      overcast day with a cloud optical depth = 10, the difference is
      less than 0.02 percent (based on high-resolution spectral
      calculations supplied by the University of Maryland).  Thus, a
      positive bias between 0 and 1 percent (depending on monthly
      averaged cloud cover) may be expected when satellite estimates of
      downward irradiance are compared with ground truth.



      Of the ISCCP cells which contain GEBA sites, approximately 75
      percent contain only one GEBA site.  An intercomparison of
      satellite results with ground truth values assumes that the
      fluxes averaged over a month over the entire ISCCP cell are the
      same as the monthly average of the fluxes over the ground truth
      site.  A site may not be representative of an ISCCP cell if it is
      in a polluted, obstructed, unusually cloudy, or frequently foggy
      area relative to the rest of the cell.  In some cases (much of
      Europe and a few other locations), there are multiple ground
      sites per ISCCP cell.  The cell-averaged ground truth values from
      these few multi-site cells can be used with more confidence.


      Comparisons are made for five combinations of ground truth as defined
      below:



******************************************************************************

      1. GERMANY - Three ISCCP cells with seven or more GEBA sites for each
            cell.  There are not enough cells to calculate total RMS
            statistics. Bias is based on average differences.

******************************************************************************

      GEBA SUBSET - GEBA sites in mountains, at high altitudes, or at
            potentially foggy coastal sites have been eliminated from the
            TOTAL GEBA SET.

      2. EUROPE MULTI-SITE GEBA SUBSET - Multi-site cells in Europe only, most
            with only two or three sites. (Approximately 20 ISCCP cells.)

      3. MULTI-SITE GEBA SUBSET - All multi-site cells from Europe, Canada,
            the Far East, and Fuji are included. (Approximately 25 ISCCP
            cells.)

      4. GEBA SUBSET multi-site and single-site cells over the globe are
            included. (Approximately 100 ISCCP cells.)

*****************************************************************************

      5. TOTAL GEBA SET - All sites pass the GEBA quality test, but many are
            in mountains, at high altitudes, or at questionable coastal
            locations. (Approximately 250 ISCCP cells.)

7 DEFINITIONS OF SRB PARAMETERS AND CODES


      In an effort to provide additional information that can be used
      to explain variations in the surface SW irradiance, the SRB data
      set includes supplemental information from GEBA, ISCCP, and ERBE
      in addition to SDAC- derived parameters.  Of the SDAC-derived
      parameters, it must be noted that items 23 and 24 in file
      srb_monavgs_yymm are the only parameters that can be verified
      with satellite-scale ground truth.



      Caution is required in the use of items 30 through 41 because the
      uncertainty levels of these parameters cannot be determined from
      satellite- scale ground-truth measurements at the present time.
      Items 42 through 50 are diagnostic parameters which may aid the
      user in estimating the uncertainty of non-verified items.


      In the definitions which follow, parameter names are noted by all
      capital letters, and explanations of the parameters are in lower
      case.

       8. NUMBER OF GROUND TRUTH SITES IN CELL.

       9. NUMBER OF DAYS OF MISSING ISCCP RADIANCE DATA THAT WERE FILLED, days
	    (Staylor value).  This number allows the user to know how
	    much radiation data for this cell is based on real ISCCP
	    data and how much is based on fill values obtained by
	    interpolation.  The Pinker algorithm also fills over gaps
	    of missing data.

	    percentage of time when snow/ice cover is greater than 10
	    percent and the surface temperature (ISCCP PARAMETER 115) is
	    less than 285 DEG K over a 5-day period.  The value is
	    calculated as a percentage of days when actual data are
	    available.  Thus, data gaps are assumed to have the same
	    snow/ice frequency as data days.  When average surface
	    temperature is greater than 285 DEG K over a 5-day period,
	    Staylor assumes that the snow/ice cover has melted and
	    modifies ISCCP PARAMETER 13 accordingly.

            ISCCP PARAMETER 5 over the month).

            daylight sum of ISCCP PARAMETERS 127, 128, 129, 130, and 131 (from
            TOVS) over the month).

      19. ISCCP TOTAL COLUMN OZONE, Dobson units (linear average of daylight
            values of ISCCP PARAMETER 132 (from TOVS) over the month).

  7.3 DESCRIPTION OF BINARY HIERARCHICAL DATA FORMAT (HDF) FILES 



      Files srb_monavgs_yymm and srb_dayavgs_yymm are stored in Version
      3.2r1 HDF format.  It is recommended that the user install HDF
      software on his or her computer system.  The software is
      available on the National Center for Supercomputing Applications
      (NCSA) anonymous FTP server (ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu, IP address
      141.142.20.50) in the directory HDF/HDF3.2r1.  The user may view
      the data by using a generic HDF read program provided by the
      Langley DAAC, or by importing the HDF data files into a visual
      data analysis transform program such as Spyglass Transform.



      The SRB HDF files srb_monavgs_yymm and srb_dayavgs_yymm differ
      from the usual HDF convention in two ways. First, the COORDSYS
      parameter in the HDF subroutine DSGDAST contains the value for
      missing data (-1000.0000) instead of information pertaining to
      the coordinate system.  Second, maximum and minimum values
      retrieved using the HDF subroutine DSGRANG are not the maximum
      and minimum values for a particular data month.  They are,
      instead, a wider range used for plotting purposes.




APPENDIX A. - DESCRIPTION OF PINKER METHOD



      The algorithm was developed at the University of Maryland by R.
      T.  Pinker and I. Laszlo.  It is a physical model based on
      radiative transfer calculations using the delta-Eddington
      approximation.  The model is an improvement and extension on
      earlier concepts (Pinker and Ewing, 1985) and is described in
      more detail in Pinker and Laszlo (1992).


1. SHORTWAVE RADIATION BUDGET RETRIEVAL



      The radiative fluxes at the boundaries of the atmosphere are
      computed by determining the atmospheric transmission and
      reflection and the surface albedo pertaining to a particular
      satellite observation.  The upward and downward fluxes, F, at the
      TOA and the surface (SRF), in each of five spectral intervals
      spanning the range of 0.2-4.0 micrometers, are computed from the
      following equations:



      F(toa,down) = PI*F0*cos(THETA0)                             (A1)
      F(toa,up) = F(toa,down)*(R0(THETA0)+r*TTILDA)               (A2)
      F(srf,down) = F(srf,down,dir)+F(srf,down,dif)               (A3)
                  = F(toa,down)*(T0(dir,THETA0)
                        +T0(dif,THETA0)+r*RTILDA)
      F(srf,up) = a(dir)*F(srf,down,dir)+a(dif)*F(srf,down,dif)   (A4)


where:


      r = (a(dir,THETA0)*T0(dir,THETA0)+a(dif,THETA0)*T0(dif,THETA0))/        
            (1-a(dif,THETA0)*RTILDA)                              (A5)


In the equations above, THETA0 is the solar zenith angle, PI*F0 is the
extraterrestrial irradiance, and R0(THETA0) and T0(THETA0) are the
reflectivity and transmissivity of the atmosphere over a nonreflecting
surface, respectively.  The terms dir and dif refer to the direct and
diffuse components of (1) the surface downward flux (F(srf,down,dir)
and F(srf,down,dif)), (2) the transmissivity (T0(dir,THETA0) and
T0(dif,THETA0)), and (3) the surface albedo (a(dir) and a(dif)).
RTILDA and TTILDA are the spherical reflectivity and transmissivity,
respectively, representing the integrals of R0(THETA0) and T0(THETA0)
over THETA0.  The reflectivities R0(THETA0), RTILDA and
transmissivities T0(dir,THETA0), T0(dif,THETA0), TTILDA (hereafter
optical functions) are functions of the composition of the atmosphere:
amount of water vapor, ozone, aerosol, and cloud.



      To compute the fluxes from equations (A1) through (A4), the
      spectral surface albedos a(dir) and a(dif) and the optical
      functions should be determined.  The algorithm retrieves them
      from the satellite- measured value of the TOA narrowband visible
      radiance and from satellite-retrieved values of ozone and water
      vapor abundances by comparing the satellite radiances to a
      radiative model.  The radiative model contains spectral values of
      the optical functions precomputed for discrete values of the
      solar zenith angle as well as amounts of water vapor, ozone,
      aerosol, and cloud optical depth.  It is currently based on the
      delta-Eddington approximation of the radiative transfer in a
      vertically inhomogeneous, scattering, and absorbing atmosphere
      (see section 2 of this appendix).  The delta-Eddington
      approximation was chosen over more sophisticated methods because
      it provides fast and relatively accurate computations of fluxes
      over a wide range of optical parameters.



      The imaging instruments on board the operational satellites
      measure radiances in narrow spectral bands.  To retrieve optical
      functions, the measured narrowband radiances should be compared
      with modeled quantities of the same type.  The delta-Eddington
      approximation, however, provides fluxes, not radiances.
      Moreover, the narrowband satellite radiances cannot be simulated
      because the five spectral intervals of the radiative model are
      too course for incorporating the filter functions of the various
      imaging instruments.  Therefore, the broadband (0.2-4.0
      micrometer) TOA albedos are used for the comparison between
      satellite-derived and modeled quantities.  For this purpose, the
      satellite-measured narrowband radiances are first transformed
      into broadband reflectances by applying narrow-to- broadband
      conversions (Laszlo et al., 1988) for clear ocean, land, desert,
      snow, and cloudy scenes:



      R(b,THETA,THETA0,PHI) = M*R(THETA,THETA0,PHI,n)+B           (A6)


where:


      R(n,THETA,THETA0,PHI) = (PI*L(THETA,THETA0,PHI))
                                    /(PI*F0*cos(THETA0))          (A7)


Here THETA and PHI are the satellite zenith angle and the relative
azimuth angle, respectively.  R(n,THETA,THETA0,PHI) is the narrowband
bidirectional reflectance computed from the satellite-measured radiance
L(THETA,THETA0,PHI), and R(b,THETA, THETA0, PHI) is the broadband
reflectance.  M and b are the slope and offset of the
narrow-to-broadband conversion, respectively.  The broadband
reflectance is then converted into a broadband albedo (R(b,THETA0))
using the anisotropic factors (CHI(THETA,THETA0,PHI)) of Suttles et al.
(1988) given as:



      R(b,THETA0) = R(b,THETA,THETA0,PHI)/CHI(THETA,THETA0,PHI)   (A8)



      The spectral surface albedo is determined in two steps.  First,
      by applying the transformations mentioned above, a broadband TOA
      upward flux is obtained from the narrowband clear-sky composite
      radiance in the ISCCP data. This radiance is a "time average" of
      the clear-sky radiances, and it is assumed that it represents
      typical (climatological) surface and aerosol conditions.  Next, a
      broadband TOA upward flux is calculated by summing up the
      spectral fluxes obtained from (A2).  The optical functions used
      in (A2) are determined for satellite-retrieved values of ozone
      and water vapor amounts and climatological values of aerosol
      optical depths.  The spectral surface albedos are prescribed from
      the ocean and land albedo models of Briegleb et al. (1986) and
      the snow albedo model of Wiscombe and Warren (1980) (see section
      2.5 of this appendix).  The calculated flux is then compared to
      the one obtained from the narrowband clear-sky composite
      radiance.  If there is no agreement, the spectral values of the
      surface albedo models are adjusted (multiplied by a constant),
      and the second step is repeated until a match of the TOA fluxes
      is achieved.  The adjusted surface albedos that yield a match of
      the TOA fluxes constitute the retrieved values of the surface
      albedo.



      The procedures described above require satellite and scene
      identification.  The ISCCP data provide most of the needed
      information: type of satellite used and clear/cloudy scene
      identification.  Discrimination between clear scenes (ocean,
      land, and desert) is based on the work of Matthews (1985).


      Once the surface albedo is known, the optical functions for clear
      and cloudy conditions are determined by matching the broadband
      TOA albedos, derived from the clear and cloudy radiances of the
      ISCCP data, respectively, with TOA albedos in the radiative model
      of the surface-atmosphere system. Since the amounts of ozone,
      water vapor, and the surface albedo are given, the process
      requires searching through various values of the aerosol optical
      thickness for clear-sky conditions and of the cloud optical
      thickness for cloudy-sky conditions until a match in the TOA
      albedos is found.  The optical functions associated with the
      model which provide the best match are taken as the retrieved
      values.  The retrieved optical functions, along with the surface
      albedos, are then used in equations (A1) through (A4) to compute
      the fluxes for clear (F(clear)) and cloudy (F(cloudy))
      conditions.  The all- sky flux, F(all), is obtained by using the
      information on cloud cover:



      F(all) = ((n(clear)*F(clear))+(n(cloudy)*F(cloudy)))
                  /(n(clear)+n(cloudy))                           (A9)



where n(clear) and n(cloudy) are the number of clear and cloudy pixels
from which the clear and cloudy ISCCP radiances are obtained.



      The instantaneous fluxes computed from (A9) are integrated
      numerically for the daylight hours and divided by 24 hours to
      obtain a daily average.  At times when no observations are
      available, the fluxes are interpolated from the preceding and
      following observations.  Because of the finite number of
      observations available per day, the total daily flux obtained
      from numerically integrating the instantaneous fluxes is
      potentially inaccurate.  Therefore, the daily total fluxes are
      adjusted by the ratio of the TOA incoming flux as obtained by an
      analytical integration to that computed from the numerical
      integration.  To account for missing days in the monthly
      averages, first, an average TOA and surface albedo and an average
      transmittance are computed from the daily average fluxes.  The
      monthly mean TOA downward flux computed analytically
      (FBAR(toa,down,analytical)) is then multiplied by the average TOA
      albedo to yield the monthly mean of the TOA upward flux.
      Similarly, the product of FBAR(toa,down,analytical) and the
      average transmittance gives the monthly mean of the surface
      downward flux.  The monthly mean of the surface upward flux is
      then obtained by multiplying monthly mean surface downward flux
      by the average surface albedo.  The above procedure assumes that
      the days with observations are representative of the entire
      month.



      The parameters of the ISCCP data used as inputs to the algorithm,
      and their primary functions, are summarized in Table A1.

2. ATMOSPHERIC RADIATIVE TRANSFER COMPONENT

      

      The reflected and transmitted radiation are computed for a
      plane-parallel, vertically inhomogeneous, scattering and
      absorbing atmosphere in five spectral intervals (0.2-0.4,
      0.4-0.5, 0.5-0.6, 0.6-0.7, 0.7-4.0 micrometer) using the
      delta-Eddington approximation of radiative transfer. The
      rationale for the selection of the delta-Eddington approach and
      the accuracy of this method are discussed in Pinker and Ewing
      (1985).  The atmospheric radiative transfer model accounts for
      (1) absorption by ozone and water vapor; (2) multiple scattering
      by molecules; (3) multiple scattering and absorption by aerosols
      and cloud droplets; and (4) multiple reflection between the
      atmosphere and the surface.  It has five or six layers, depending
      on the aerosol profile considered and on whether a cloud is
      present.  The parameterizations used in the atmospheric radiative
      transfer model will be described in the following section.


      2.1 OZONE AND WATER VAPOR ABSORPTION



      The fraction of the incident solar radiation absorbed by ozone in
      a layer, A, is computed following Lacis and Hansen (1974):


     A = A(x) + R(THETA0)*A(x)                                     (A10)



where THETA0 is the solar zenith angle, R(THETA0) is the reflectivity
of the atmosphere-surface system below the absorbing ozone layer, and x
is the relative optical ozone pathlength.  The first term represents
the absorption of the downwelling direct radiation, while the second
one gives the absorption of the upwelling diffuse radiation.  Ozone
absorption is accounted for in the 0.2-0.4 micrometer (UV) and in the
0.5-0.6 micrometer (VIS) spectral intervals (Lacis and Hansen, 1974):



     AUV = (1.082*x)/((1+(138.6*x))**0.805)
                   +(0.0658*x)/(1+((103.6*x)**3))                  (A11)

                      
     AVIS = (0.02118*x)/(1+(0.042*x)+(0.000323*(x**2)))            (A12)



      The absorption by water vapor, Awv, in the 0.7-4.0 micrometer
      band is computed in terms of the discrete probability
      distribution (p(kn)) of the absorption coefficients (kn)
      following Lacis and Hansen (1974):


     Awv(Y(L)) = 1-summation from n=1 to n=8 
                              of (p(kn)*e**(-kn*Y(L)))             (A13)



Here Y(L) is the effective water vapor amount (temperature and pressure
scaled amount) in the Lth atmospheric layer.  The amount of ozone and
the effective water vapor amount in each layer of the atmosphere were
obtained from detailed data on ozone and water vapor densities,
temperature,  and pressure at 31 levels of the Standard Atmospheres
(tropical, mid-latitude  summer and winter, subarctic summer and
winter) (Kneizys et al., 1980).



      2.2 RAYLEIGH SCATTERING



      The Rayleigh scattering optical depth of a layer, dTAU, between levels L
and L-1 (Penndorf, 1957) is expressed as:



    DTAU = 27.019*t*((1+(0.5*(z(L-1)+z(L)))/6371)**2)*(1+29/18r)

                                              /(1+r)(p(L)-p(L-1))  (A14)



where:

     z(L), z(L-1) - heights (km) at levels L and L-1

     p(L), p(L-1) - pressures (mb) at levels L and L-1

     r - relative humidity in the layer

     t - a function of wavelength, depolarization factor, and the refractive
            index of the air.



     Equation (A14) includes corrections for humidity and the variation
     of gravitation with altitude.  The parameter t was computed with
     the high spectral resolution radiation model ATRAD (Wiscombe et
     al., 1984).  The spectral values of parameter t are listed in
     table A2.

     2.3 AEROSOL EXTINCTION



      Two atmospheric aerosol profiles (MAR-I and CONT-I) of the
      Standard Radiation Atmosphere (WCP-55, 1983) are used in the
      radiative transfer computations.  They depict typical maritime
      and average rural- continental conditions, respectively.  These
      profiles specify the optical properties of the atmosphere in five
      layers in terms of optical depth, single scattering albedo, and
      asymmetry parameter.  In each layer, the chemo-physical
      characteristic of the aerosol is given by one of the basic
      aerosol types: continental, maritime, background stratospheric,
      and upper atmospheric.



      2.4 CLOUD EXTINCTION



      The cloud parameterization of Stephens et al. (1984) for two
      broad spectral intervals in the shortwave region (0.2-0.75
      micrometer and 0.75-4.0 micrometer) was adopted.  It is expressed
      in terms of optical thickness, TAU, single scattering albedo,
      OMEGA, and backscattered fraction of monodirectional incident
      radiation BETA(MU0), as a function of the cosine of the solar
      zenith angle, MU0.  In the solar model the radiative transfer is
      treated in the framework of the delta-Eddington approximation;
      the optical properties are described by TAU, OMEGA, and the
      asymmetry parameter, g.  In order to implement the cloud
      parameterization of Stephens into the delta- Eddington scheme, it
      is necessary to relate BETA(MU0) to g.


     The single scattering albedos and the asymmetry parameters used in
     the delta-Eddington approximation (see Table 2 of Pinker and
     Laszlo (1992)) have been derived iteratively so that they yield
     the same reflectance and absorption of clouds as those obtained
     from the Stephens' parameterization scheme.  This method allows
     the inclusion of aerosols in the atmospheric column.  The
     parameterization of Stephens does not account for aerosol
     extinction.  Because it was assumed by Stephens that the cloud
     does not absorb in the visible spectrum, the ability to include
     aerosol extinction is important.  In all the radiative transfer
     computations, the spectral interval was (0.2-4.0 micrometer) to be
     compatible with the parameterization of Stephens.  To keep the
     computations at a manageable level, a single plane- parallel cloud
     layer is assumed and both the geometrical thickness and cloud top
     height are fixed.


     2.5 SURFACE REFLECTIVITY


      The ocean- and land-albedo models of Briegleb et al. (1986) were
      adopted to prescribe the surface reflectance as a function of
      solar zenith angle, THETA0, and wavelength, LAMBDA.  In the
      land-albedo models each surface is considered to consist of two
      components, a(1,THETA0,LAMBDA) and a(2,THETA0,LAMBDA), with
      fractions f and (1-f):



     a(THETA0,LAMBDA) = f*a(1,THETA0,LAMBDA)
                                + (1-f)*a(2,THETA0,LAMBDA)         (A15)


The albedo of each component k (k = 1,2) is given as a function of the
solar zenith angle, the albedo for THETA0 = 60 degrees and an empirical
parameter, d(k) (Dickinson, 1983):


     a(k,THETA0,LAMBDA) = a(k,60 degrees,LAMBDA)
                           *(1+d(k))/(1+2*d(k)*cos(THETA0)).       (A16)


In the surface albedo models a0 is specified for four spectral
intervals in the shortwave band with boundaries at 0.2, 0.5, 0.7, 0.85
and 4.0 micrometers, as well as the values of dk and the fractions, f,
for each component.  The above parameters and the surface
reflectivities based on surface and aircraft measurements are specified
for 10 surface types (Briegleb et al., 1986).  It is assumed that land
surface albedos are the same for both the direct and the diffuse
components of the solar irradiance.  The ocean-albedo for direct solar
radiation is obtained from the following expression (Briegleb et al.,
1986):



     a(dir,THETA0) = (2.6/((((cos(THETA0))**1.7)+0.065))
      +(15(cos(THETA0)-0.1)*(cos(THETA0)-0.5)*(cos(THETA0)-1))     (A17)


For diffuse irradiance, a constant albedo value, a(dif), of 6 percent
is used. The spectral albedos of snow for the direct and diffuse
irradiance are computed from the semi-infinite snow model of Wiscombe
and Warren (1980), assuming pure, fresh snow with a grain size of 50
micrometers.  When the snow cover reported in the ISCCP data is less
than 100 percent, the albedo is computed as a weighted average of the
land/ocean and snow albedos.




APPENDIX B. - DESCRIPTION OF STAYLOR METHOD



      The algorithm was developed at NASA Langley Research Center by W.
      F.  Staylor.  It is an empirical/physical model that utilizes
      ISCCP-C1 data (Schiffer and Rossow, 1983) as its primary input
      data.  The current model is a modified version of an earlier
      model by Darnell et al. (1988), hereafter D88, that utilized TOVS
      meteorological data (Smith et al., 1979) and Heat Budget Product
      radiance data (Gruber, 1978) as input data to estimate surface
      insolation.  A recent application of the method is given in
      Darnell et al., 1992.


1. ATMOSPHERIC RADIATIVE TRANSFER COMPONENTS


      The current insolation model uses a broadband shortwave approach
      which assumes that insolation at the surface for all-sky
      conditions (clear and cloudy), ISASi, can be related as the
      product of insolation at the top of the atmosphere, ITOAi,
      clear-sky atmospheric transmittance, TA, and cloud transmittance,
      TC,


            ISASi = ITOAi*TA*TC .                                       (B1)



This is an instantaneous expression (i) and it is assumed that TA and
TC are independent.  ITOAi is given by



            ITOAi = S*cos(theta)                                        (B2)



where S is the Earth-Sun distance-corrected solar flux and theta 
is the solar zenith angle.



      Atmospheric transmittance can be expressed as



             TA = (1+0.065*PS*AS+2*J*AS)*exp(-TAU,theta)                (B3)



where PS is the surface pressure, AS is surface albedo, J is an aerosol
parameter, and (TAU,theta) is the effective clear-sky atmospheric
optical depth.  The first term in brackets relates the atmospheric
backscattering of surface reflected flux (treated as negative optical
depth in D88).  The 0.065 coefficient is the average of values given by
Lacis and Hansen (1974) and Hoyt (1978).  Surface albedo will be
treated later (see SURFACE ALBEDO).  In Fig. 2 of D88, it was found
that (TAU,theta) and the optical depth at zero degrees solar zenith
angle, (TAU,zero) were related as

             TAU,theta = TAU,zero*(sec(theta))**N                       (B4)


and the power, N, could be calculated as


             N = 2.1*(log(TAU,70.5 deg)-log(TAU,0 deg)) .               (B5)


Vertical optical depth (theta = 0 degrees) is defined as


             TAU,zero = -ln(1-(ALPHA,zero))                             (B6)


where (ALPHA,zero) is the effective downward attenuation factor for
solar energy due to all absorption and scattering processes (clear-sky
only). ALPHA,zero is the summation of six components given as


             ALPHA,zero = ALPHA,WV + ALPHA,OZ + ALPHA,02 
                           + ALPHA,CO2 +ALPHA,RAY + ALPHA,AER .         (B7)



Lacis and Hansen (1974) gave equations for the broadband absorptions of
water vapor and ozone which are approximated here as


             ALPHA,WV = 0.100*(WV)**0.27                                (B8)

and  

             ALPHA,OZ = 0.037*(OZ)**0.43 .                              (B9)


Yamamoto (1962) gave equations for the broadband absorptions of oxygen
and carbon dioxide which are approximated here as


             ALPHA,O2 = 0.002*(PS)**0.87                               (B10)

and

             ALPHA,CO2 = 0.006*(PS)**0.29 .                            (B11)


Rayleigh attenuation was estimated by Lacis and Hansen (1974) as 


             ALPHA,RAY = 0.035*PS**0.67 .                              (B12)


Aerosol attenuation was based on World Climate Program models (World
Climate Research Program, 1983) given here as


             ALPHA,AER = J/2 + K .                                     (B13)


The J term is equal to aerosol optical depth times the quantity 1 minus
the asymmetry factor, and K is equal to the optical depth times the
quantity 1 minus the single-scattering albedo.  Values for J and K are
given in Table B1 for five surface types.


      It should be noted that the Rayleigh and aerosol attenuation
      terms are concerned only with backscattering and/or absorption,
      but not with forward scattering of flux which reaches the
      surface.


      With values of S, PS, AS, WV, OZ, J, K, and TC (see INPUT DATA),
      one could compute the instantaneous insolation at the surface as
      a function of theta using equations (B1) through (B13).
      Computation of the daily insolation (d) involves the time
      integration of the instantaneous insolation (i) from sunrise (sr)
      to sunset (ss) which can be approximated as:



    ISASd = S*TC*(1 + 0.065*PS*AS+2*J*AS)
        *integral(exp(-TAU,theta)*cos(theta)*dt) taken from sr to ss   (B14)



where PS, AS, S, J, and TC are assumed to be constant for a region
during the course of each day.  Equation (14) can be evaluated as



    ISASd = S*H*TC*(1 + 0.065*PS*AS+2*J*AS)*exp(-TAU,zero*(UE)**-N)    (B15)



where H is the daily vertical Sun fraction and UE is the effective
daily cosine of the solar zenith angle.  Both H and UE are defined in
Table B2. Cloud transmittance is based on a threshold technique (D88,
Fig. 7) given by



             TC = 0.05 +0.95*(Ro-Rm)/(Ro-Rc)                           (B16)


where Ro, Rc, and Rm are the TOA reflectances for overcast, clear-sky
and measured conditions, respectively.  The coefficients 0.05 and 0.95
(rather than 0 and 1) simply relate the observation that for totally
overcast days (Rm=Ro), cloud transmittance is about 5 percent, not
zero.  Each of the three reflectance terms in equation (B16) is a daily
value obtained by weighting the ISCCP 3-hourly instantaneous values
with the cosine of the solar zenith angle, UO.  The measured value, for
instance, would be


             Rm = summation Rmi*UO/summation UO .                      (B17)


      Instantaneous overcast reflectances are estimated from a model by
      Staylor (1985) as



             Roi = D1/(UO*UV) + (D2/(UO*UV))*((UO*UV)/(UO + UV))**2    (B18)



where UV is the cosine of the viewing zenith angle and D1 and D2 are
ISCCP satellite coefficients given in Table B3.  These coefficients are
determined using ISCCP data for non-snow, totally overcast regions with
mean cloud optical depths greater than 80 for each satellite for every
month.  A linear regression of (Roi*UO*UV) versus ((UO*UV)/(UO +
UV))**2 is performed to determine D1 and D2.


      Clear-sky reflectances are determined by one of several methods
      depending on the surface type and snow cover.  For ocean regions,
      which cover the majority of the Earth's surface,



             Rci = D3 + D4*((UO*UV)**-0.75)                            (B19)



where D3 and D4 are ISCCP satellite coefficients, given in Table B3,
that were determined for totally clear ocean regions for each satellite
every month.  A linear regression of (Rci) versus ((UO*UV)**-0.75) is
performed to determine D3 and D4.  For land regions where there is no
snow or where the snow cover does not change by more than 10 percent
during the month, daily Rc values are computed from the clear-sky
pixels and the minimum value for the month is used for the entire
month.  If the snow cover changes by more than 10 percent during the
month (determined for 5-day intervals), the above procedure is still
used, but is applied to several shorter time intervals.



      Measured instantaneous reflectances, Rmi, are the pixel- weighted
      average of the clear and cloudy pixel reflectances which are then
      UO- weighted to produce the daily Rm values (equation B17).  If
      only a single Rmi value exists for a day (average of about 4 for
      the ISCCP geostationary satellites), a value of Rm can be
      computed for that day.  But if no Rmi value exists for a day
      (occurs most frequently in regions of polar satellite coverage),
      a fill value is provided by one of two methods.  If an Rm value
      exists for an adjacent longitudinal region for that day, it is
      used.  If it does not exist, then the previous day's value of Rm
      is used.  This procedure is expanded spatially, then temporally
      until a non-fill value of Rm is found.

2. SURFACE ALBEDO



      A daily surface albedo value for all-sky conditions, AS, is
      needed for the computation of insolation (equation B15), and it
      is also used in the computation of surface absorbed insolation
      which is given by


             IAASd = ISASd*(1-AS) .                                    (B20) 



The all-sky albedo is estimated as



             AS = Aso + (Asc - Aso)*(TC)**2                            (B21)



where Aso is the daily overcast albedo and Asc is the daily clear- sky
albedo. Because of the difficulty of obtaining consistent surface
albedos using the visible (0.5 - 0.7 micron: GOES, GMS, NOAA) and
near-infrared (0.7 - 1.1 micron; METEOSAT) radiances from ISCCP, daily
clear-sky albedo results from Staylor and Wilber (1990) were used which
were based on broadband ERBE scanner data.  Daily overcast albedos are
estimated to be equal to the instantaneous clear-sky albedos for a
solar zenith angle of 53 degrees (cosine = 0.6) as that is
approximately the effective downward zenith angle of diffuse rays from
clouds.  For oceans,


             Aso = 0.065 ,                                            (B22a)


and for land

             Aso = 1.1*Asc*(UE)**0.2 .                                (B22b)


3. INPUT DATA


ISCCP data sets contain data bytes (b) for 132 parameters which are
given once every 3 hours (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 GMT).  Surface
pressure is given in millibars (1000 mb = sea level pressure) and is
converted to atmospheres as

      

             PS = b114/1000 .                                          (B23)



Precipitable water vapor is given in centimeters for each of five
layers and converted to total burden in precipitable centimeters as



             WV = b127 + b128 + b129 + b130 + b131 .                   (B24)



Ozone is given in Dobson units and converted to atmosphere-cm as



             OZ = b132/1000 .                                          (B25)



The cosine of the solar zenith angle, UO, is b14/100 and the cosine of
the viewing zenith angle, UV, is b15/100.  Snow coverage in percent is
b13.  Total number of pixels in a region is b5, and the number of those
which are cloudy is b6.  Mean scaled reflectance (Rmi*UO) for the
cloudy pixels is b104, and mean scaled reflectance for the clear pixels
is b107.

      Solar declinations and Earth-Sun distances were calculated each
      day using an algorithm.  A solar flux of 1365 W/m**2 was used for
      an Earth-Sun distance of 1AU.  As mentioned previously, surface
      albedos were derived from ERBE scanner data (Staylor and Wilber,
      1990).
