  <P><EM>A timeline showing the availability of the various assimilation
  types produced by the Met Office. This is taken from a <a href="ukmo_status.ps">postscript file</a> 
  (colours adapted to improve readability on the Web) produced
  by the Met Office, also available from the BADC. NB. The use of the assimilations
  incorporating ISAMS temperatures (shown in red) is recommended
  for the 1991-91 northern winter.</EM></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
