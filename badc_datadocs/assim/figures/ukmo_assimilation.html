  <P><EM>Figure 1. A block diagram illustrating the organization
  of stratosphere-troposphere data assimilation system. Observations
  are taken from the Met Office data banks and the UARS CDHF
  (where applicable), and processed to produce quality-controlled
  observation files for input into the data assimilation. The assimilation
  then produces an analysis. Forecast and analysis data from the
  assimilation are also fed back into the observation processing,
  where they are used to quality-control the observations. (Adapted
