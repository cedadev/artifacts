<P><HR ALIGN=LEFT>The Met Office assimilated data was supplied to the
BADC by the Met Office as IEEE Unix binary files in Met Office
&quot;PP&quot; format. For the vast majority of users, the binary
files can be read directly, without going through a ascii-binary
conversion step. The files were written on HP machines and have
been read directly on SUN, SGI and AIX. We have also read them
under DEC Unix using the f77 -convert big_endian compiler option.</P>

<P>We supply an example read program to read the binary data,
and 3rd party software written by other users of the data, which
we do not support.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>The Met Office Assimilated Data directories can be browsed
  using the web at <A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/ukmo-assim/data/">/badc/ukmo-assim/data/</A>.
  We suggest that you look here to check whether the data you require
  is available. Please note that since these data are restricted, 
  you need to apply for access to the Met Office assimilated data, before
downloading the data over the WWW. The <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dataset_registration/dataset_info.cgi.pl?datasetid=assim">online application for access to the Met Office Assimilated data</a>
 includes the Met Office Agreement to be electronically accepted.</P>
  <P>The data are updated every night from the Met Office -
  check the updates file for the latest file additions.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

  <H4><A NAME="structure"></A>3.1 The file structure</H4>
  <P>Each file contains an analysis for a single date, or in cases
  where the analyses have been produced every six hours, for a
  single time.</P>
  <P>The file contains fixed length 28288 byte records. The first
  record contains a text header incorporating the standard UARS
  headers, and a list of meta data including geographical and vertical
  ranges and parameters available in the file.</P>
  <P>Each subsequent record contains a parameter field for a single
  pressure level. The records are ordered by decreasing pressure,
  and all records for one parameter are grouped together in the
  file. Thus zonal wind fields for all 22 pressure levels are followed
  by the fields for the meridional winds and so on.</P>
  <P>Schematically the file has the following structure (the letters
  <I>pl </I>denote pressure level):</P>

  <P>This file structure is also used for the monthly averaged
  data which are stored in the &quot;means&quot; sub-directory.</P>
  <P>Using the Met Office -supplied access routines is recommended, (see
  below) since you are then shielded from the underlying file structure.
  For a very detailed description of the file structure and the
  contents of each field refer to the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/ukmo-assim/doc/ieee_binary/badc_ukmo.txt">documentation</A>
  produced by the Met Office.</P>
  <H4><A NAME="routines"></A>3.2 The Met Office Access Routines</H4>
  <P>Software routines to read these data have been supplied by
  the Met Office. There is also a routine to calculate Ertel Potential
  Vorticity from the analyses.</P>
  <P>Two basic approaches may be used to read the Met Office analyses.
  Firstly, a complete field may be read at a single level (eg.
  for map plotting); this method minimises interpolation errors
  since the values are on the original horizontal grid points.
  Alternatively, a set of profiles may be derived at specific locations;
  this method is intended for comparing the analysis data with
  observed profiles.</P>
  <P>To access this data use the following routines:</P>
 
  <PRE>
    To open a file:                         UKAOPN
    To read a field at one level:           UKAFLD
    To define profiles at several levels:   UKAPRF
    To calculate Ertel potential velocity:  PV_UKA
    To close a file:                        UKACLS
    To print a diagnostic message:          UKAPRT</PRE>
  <P>Users should note the the routines which extract a field of
  data (UKAFLD and PV_UKA), return the field as a 1-dimensional
  array of 7008 points. Within this array, gridpoints are grouped
  in rows at a constant latitude, with high northerly latitudes
  appearing first.</P>
  <P>Detailed documentation on these routines was produced by the
  Met Office and is <A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/ukmo-assim/doc/ieee_binary/badc_ukmo.txt">available
  online</A> from the BADC.</P>
  <H4><A NAME="3rdparty"></A>3.3 Third Party Software</H4>
  <P>In the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/ukmo-assim/software/">software directories</A>
  for the Met Office Assimilations, there is a subdirectory for 3rd Party
  software. If you develop software to use with the Met Office assimilation
  data, then we encourage you to let us have a copy so that we
  can make it available to other researchers.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
