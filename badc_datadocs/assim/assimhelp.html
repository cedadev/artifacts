<H2><A NAME="scheme"></A>1. The Met Office Assimilation Scheme</H2>

<P>This section contains only a brief outline of the assimilation
scheme and the data processing steps which involved in the production
of these data. Users requiring a more detailed description should
consult <A HREF="references.html">Swinbank and O'Neill</A> (1994)</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <H3><A NAME="assimilation"></A>1.1 Data Assimilation</H3>
  <P>Assimilation is essentially an analysis technique that fits
  a model to observed data. The model (in this case a numerical
  forecast model of the stratosphere and troposphere) provides
  a strong constraint to the analysis problem, i.e. the model ensures
  that the analysed fields are physically self-consistent. The
  assimilation technique allows data of many different types (for
  example satellite soundings, radiosondes and aircraft data) to
  be included in the analysis. By contrast, conventional analysis
  schemes can only use data of a single type - for example the
  <A HREF="/data/tovs/">Met Office TOVS analyses</A> described
  by <A HREF="/data/tovs/references.html">Bailey et al.</A> (1991) which are
  also available form the BADC.</P>
  <P>While the model is being integrated forward in time, the model
  state is nudged towards observed values; the observation weights
  take into account the expected accuracy of each observation type.</P>
  <P>The UARS assimilation system has been developed from the new
  Met Office data assimilation scheme for operational weather forecasting
  - the so called analysis-correction scheme described in <A HREF="references.html">Lorenc
  et al.</A> (1991). The forecast model at the heart of the assimilation
  system is the Met. Office Unified Model which is capable of being
  run at many different resolutions. For the UARS project it is
  configured so that its vertical coverage extends from the earth's
  surface to above the stratopause.</P>
  <P>The model is a global primitive equation model, with a split-explicit
  time integration scheme. It incorporates a comprehensive range
  of physical parametrization schemes. It uses a hybrid vertical
  coordinate system, with terrain-following model levels at low
  levels, gradually changing to pressure levels in the stratosphere.</P>
  <H3><A NAME="process"></A>1.2 Overview of Data Processing</H3>
  <P>The assimilation system can be divided into the following
  separate stages, which are shown schematically in <A HREF="figures/ukmo_assimilation.html">Fig.
  1</A>:</P>
  <H4>Extraction of Observations</H4>
  <P>The first stage in the production is the extraction the necessary
  data from the Met. Office Data banks, or in case of Level 3A
  UARS data, from the UARS <A HREF="http://www-uars.gsfc.nasa.gov/"
  TARGET="_top">Central Data Handling Facility</A> (CDHF) at NASA
  Goddard.</P>
  <H4>Observation pre-processing and quality control:</H4>
  <P>The observational data are transcribed into a standard format
  and are quality controlled by checking against forecast data,
  using a Bayesian approach devised by <A HREF="references.html">Lorenc
  and Hammond</A> (1988). Data are extracted from forecast fields
  at observation locations, and a statistical test is performed
  to establish whether an observation is grossly in error. In addition
  a &quot;buddy check&quot; is carried out so that if observations
  of a different type are consistent with each other, then they
  are more likely to be accepted, even if they differ substantially
  from the forecast.</P>
  <H4>Assimilation and forecast:</H4>
  <P>The assimilation is run by integrating the numerical model
  in assimilation mode. The model is integrated forward in time
  and model fields are adjusted towards the observed data so that
  the model state is a realistic representation of the atmosphere
  within the assumed errors. The model is also run in forecast
  mode - in which the model state is governed purely by the model
  equations.</P>
  <P>At the end of the assimilation, the analyzed fields are interpolated
  to standard pressure levels and written out.</P>
  <H4>Observation post-processing:</H4>
  <P>In the final stage of the observation processing, an observation
  processing dataset (OPD) is compiled. For each observation used
  in the analysis, this contains the observed value, the difference
  between the observation and the analysis value and the difference
  from the background value. Thus the OPD is a valuable resource
  for validating both the assimilation and the observations.</P>
  <P>Error statistics generated from the OPD give users of the
  assimilated data information on the quality of the analysis.</P>
  <H3><A NAME="non-uars"></A>1.3 &quot;Non-UARS&quot; Assimilations</H3>
  <P>The standard product consists of analyses produced using operational
  data - essentially the same data as is used for operational weather
  forecasting i.e. the World Weather Watch network of surface and
  upper air observations and satellite data. They are also referred
  to as &quot;correlative analyses&quot; since they are produced to allow
  UARS investigators to check their retrievals against an independent
  analysis. The analyses have been produced operationally since
  October 1995.</P>
  <H3><A NAME="uars"></A>1.4 &quot;UARS&quot; Assimilations</H3>
  <P>The assimilation scheme has also been run in experiments to
  incorporate UARS data <EM>in addition</EM> to the standard meteorological
  observations. These do not form a continuous sequence, but rather
  a set of experiments to assimilate particular combinations of
  data from different instruments.</P>
  <P>Note that in the case of the 1991-92 NH winter, the assimilations
  incorporating temperatures from the UARS ISAMS instrument are
  thought to be superior to the &quot;non-UARS&quot; data, and
  should be used in preference.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <H3><A NAME="spatial_coverage"></A>2.1 Spatial Coverage</H3>
  <H4>Vertical Coverage</H4>
  <P>All fields are on the 22 UARS pressure levels from 1000 HPa
  to 0.316 HPa inclusive - approximately 0-55km. (These fields
  are vertically interpolated from the model data; currently the
  model has 42 levels, with a vertical resolution in the stratosphere
  of about 1.6 km)</P>
  <H4>Horizontal Coverage</H4>
  <P>The data fields are on the grid used by the numerical model
  which covers the whole globe. The grid is described in the section
  on the Resolution below.</P>
  <H3><A NAME="temporal_coverage"></A>2.2 Temporal Coverage</H3>
  <P>Analyses are available at the CDHF for 12 GMT daily from Oct
  17th 1991 with a time lag of a 2-3 days, and shortly thereafter
  from the BADC. There is a separate file for each day. For periods
  of special interest, files may be provided four times per day
  at 0:00, 6.00, 12.00 and 18.00 GMT. The near real-time assimilation
  data have version numbers V0001 or V0002; higher version numbers
  denote periods re-run at a later date. Most of the changes made
  to the assimilation system have not made large differences to
  the analyses. However, users should note the following significant
  changes:-</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <PRE>
   07-Dec-91    The original assimilation run has poor 
                upper levels  (p &lt; 3 hPa), which was 
                improved mainly by quality control 
                changes (from 7 Dec  to 16 Dec.
  
   07-Jan-92    Polar filtering improved. 
  
   27-May-92    Polar filtering improved.
                This error gave very poor flow near the 
                pole on a few occasions where there 
                were strong winds at high latitudes.  
  
   26-Aug-92    Vertical velocities introduced.  
  
   22-Feb-93    Divergence damping increased. Gave 
                less noisy temperatures at  upper levels 
                (p ~1hPa), with a better fit to
                observations.
                
   16-Oct-95    Switch over to operational stratospheric run. 
                Still uses the same version of the model, but is
                run as four six-hourly cycles per day instead of 
                one 24hour assimilation job. It is run closer to 
                real-time, so the observation coverage might be 
                slightly poorer if data is delayed.</PRE>
  <P>The temporal coverage of the various assimilation types is
  summarised in <A HREF="figures/ukmo_status.html">Fig. 2.</A>.
  Users should note that there is a sequence of data from the 1991-92
  northern winter which assimilates temperatures from the ISAMS
  instrument. These files should be used in preference to the standard
  product.</P>
  <H3><A NAME="resolution"></A>2.3 Resolution</H3>
  <P>The assimilated data are stored on standard UARS pressure
  levels from 100hPa to 0.316hPa (approximately 55km). The UARS
  pressure levels are given by the following relation:</P>
  <PRE>
     <EM> p(i) = 1000 x 10^(-i/6),  i=0 to 21</EM></PRE>
  <P>The horizontal resolution is the same as the numerical model
  used for data assimilation. The model uses a staggered grid (known
  as an &quot;Arakawa B grid&quot;, so that wind fields are stored
  on different points from the other fields.</P>
  <P>The wind fields (u,v,w) are on a 2.5 degree (latitude) * 3.75
  degree (longitude) global grid, with the first point at 88.75N,

  Note that the figures do NOT take into account any bias in the
  original operational (NOAA/NESDIS) temperature retrievals. In
  general, the errors will be more than average at high latitudes
  and in winter. In particular, errors will be larger (perhaps
  10-20K locally) during dynamically active periods such as stratospheric
  warmings. The errors will also be larger near the tropopause
  (200-300 hPa in mid-latitudes), as indicated in the table.</P>

  <P>The wind errors in the troposphere are derived from OPD statistics

  these errors are applicable to the two wind components independently,
  the RMS vector wind error will be a factor of approximately sqrt(2)
  larger. The 10 hPa and 1 hPa figures (in brackets) are indicative
  estimates; they are consistent with differences found between
  the <A HREF="/data/tovs/">Met Office TOVS analyses</A> and the

<H2><A NAME="changes"></A>3. Data Assimilation Changes</h2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In November 2000, a new stratospheric data assimilation system was implemented, based on the 3D variational (3DVAR) data assimilation system used for the standard global forecast suite. The 3DVAR stratospheric system includes the assimilation of radiances (rather than temperature retrievals) from the operational polar orbiter satellites.
<P>In October 2003, the assimilation model was changed to use a new semi-Lagrangian dynamical core, usually referred to as "new dynamics". The model is a 50-level configuration of the Unified Model; the tropospheric levels are the same as those used in the 38-level global forecast model, but additional stratospheric levels have been introduced. This model configuration has been designed to help to demonstrate the benefit of additional stratospheric levels on the processing of satellite temperature soundings. More details about the New Dynamics package is available on the Met Office <a href="http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/nwp/numerical/unified_model/new_dynamics.html">New Dynamics factsheet</a>.
