Introduction
</h2>

<p>
One of the most important feedbacks in the natural climate system involves the emission of gases from the ocean surface. One important gas, dimethyl sulphide, leads to the formation of particles in the air (aerosol). These particles strongly influence the nature of clouds, which in turn play a large part in controlling global temperatures. Emissions of dimethyl sulphide may be different in a future climate. It is therefore important to understand how changes in the emission of this gas affect the aerosol in the marine atmosphere. A new global model of aerosols will be used to quantify how chemical and meteorological processes control the size of the particles, their chemical composition, variability in time and space, and their ability to form clouds. The principal outcomes of this work will be a complete assessment of our understanding of marine aerosols as well as a fully evaluated global aerosol/chemistry model. The model will also be used to develop an improved version of the UK climate model.

Availability of data
</h2>

<p>
The model used is the Global Model of Aerosol Processes(GLOMAP) and is hosted in the TOMCAT transport model. No data are yet available but final outputs will be 3D gridded fields of trace gases, aersol size distributions and composition.

The data are restricted to project participants for 1 year following generation, and to UK SOLAS participants for a further year, see details in
the <a href="/conditions/solas.html">UK SOLAS Data Protocol</a>. Once public, requirements will continue 
to apply to publications based on the data.
