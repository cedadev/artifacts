UK SOLAS Project: Dust Outflow and Deposition to Ocean  (DODO)
</h1>

<hr>
This page supplements the main <a href="http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/data/solas">UK SOLAS programme page </a> 
with details that relate only to the DODO project.

Introduction
</h2>

<p>
The Dust Outflow and Deposition to Ocean (DODO) project is a 
<a href="http://www.nerc.ac.uk/research/programmes/solas/">UK SOLAS</a> project 
which also has links with the <a href="http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/data/dabex">DABEX</a> 
and <a href="http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/data/amma">AMMA</a> projects. 
</p>
<p>
Case studies will be conducted using in situ measurements made by the <a href="http://www.faam.ac.uk/">FAAM</a> 
BAe-146 aircraft to predict dust deposition to the northern hemisphere 
Atlantic Ocean. 
These studies will describe how changing chemical and physical properties in the dust 
affect its long range transport and will assess the radiative impact of the 
dust and its effect on sea surface temperatures in nutrient rich waters of the 
Atlantic Ocean. The dust sources will be fingerprinted using single particle characterisation and 
by assessing their main composition. 
The climatological representativeness of the studies will be assessed and used to
predict the seasonal footprint of dust deposition to the north Atlantic Ocean.

Availability of data
</h2>

<p>
Some DODO data are publicly available while other data are restricted. Data collected onboard the FAAM BAe-146
aircraft are split into core data and non-core data and a definition of those instruments that are part of the 
core suite is given on the <a href="http://www.faam.ac.uk/public/instrumentation.html">FAAM Instruments page</a>.
<ul>
<li>Processed core data collected on board the FAAM aircraft are
    public access but require application.
<li>Raw core data collected on board the FAAM aircraft are restricted to FAAM
    staff and scientists involved in test flights.
<li>Access to all other DODO data is
    restricted to DODO participants for a period of
    one year following the end of the data set collection, as per the <a href="/conditions/solas.html">UK SOLAS Conditions of Use</a>. Following this period, there is a further year of
    restriction to SOLAS participants. Data will then be made public but
    requirements will continue to apply to publications based on DODO data.
<li>It has been agreed that participants in the DABEX and AMMA campaigns can also have access to the data, but 
it is still necessary to register for DODO in order to accept the DODO conditions of use which are different to those 
in the co-operating programmes.
<li>It has been agreed that DODO participants can also access data from the <a href="http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/data/dabex">DABEX</a> and 
<a href="http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/data/amma">AMMA</a> campaigns.
</ul>

<li>
    All other DODO data are now public
   &#151; All users are requested to acknowledge the data providers in any publication 
based on DODO data.

<p>An agreement  is also in place to give DODO participants access to data from the related 
<a href="http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/data/amma">AMMA</a> and 
<a href="http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/data/dabex">DABEX</a> campaigns. Please refer to the dataset web pages
for details on how to gain access and mention DODO participation in your application. Similarly, AMMA and DABEX participants can gain
access to DODO data. Please mention you are a participant of these projects when registering.

<p><b>(2) Where to find the data</b></p>
<p>
Data and documentation supplied to the BADC by the project team are stored in
the <a href="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/solas/data/dodo/">DODO archive</a>,
from where they can be viewed and downloaded by authorised users.
