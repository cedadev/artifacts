UK SOLAS Project: Reactive Halogens in the Marine Boundary Layer (RHaMBLe)
</h1>

<hr>
This page supplements the main <a href="http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/data/solas">UK SOLAS programme page </a> 
with details that relate only to the RHaMBLe project.

Introduction
</h2>

<p>
RHaMBLe aims to quantify impacts of marine halogen emissions on atmospheric composition by the direct 
observation of a range of reactive halogen species (RHS) in the marine atmosphere. Emphasis is placed on the roles of halogens in 
oxidative processes and on secondary aerosol formation and transformations resulting from the cycling of RHS. 
<p>RHaMBLe includes open ocean and coastal measurements. 
Two open ocean deployments will link with proposed long-term studies in the tropical Atlantic Ocean on Sao Vicente in the Cape Verde 
Islands: i) an intensive campaign and supplementation of the continuous measurements already funded at Cape Verde and ii) a 
simultaneous ship transect through the biologically-active upwelling region west of Mauritania. These will provide possibly the most 
comprehensive characterisation of halogen compounds in the marine atmosphere to date, including both organic and inorganic reactive 
species and providing substantial spatial and temporal coverage. The coastal field project will provide direct observational 
linkage between new particle formation and RHS, to enable development of a usable parameterisation for use in large-scale models.
