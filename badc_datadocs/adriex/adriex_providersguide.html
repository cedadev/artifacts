<b>Data file names.</b>
<P>Data providers are kindly requested to follow the BADC
<a href="/help/file_naming.html">file name convention</a>.
<li>
Note that the first component of the file name is the instrument (or group of
instruments, or model) name.
A list of standard
<a href="/filespec_doc?id=INSTRUMENTAL&hfile=1#Instrument">instrument/model names</a>, including the FAAM instruments, is available.
Please advise the <a href="mailto:badc@rl.ac.uk">BADC</a> if you can't find
your instrument or model in the list, or if you would like to record data from
several instruments in a single file, so that we can update the list (in
agreement with the FAAM board if it is an instrument or a group of instruments
flying on the FAAM aircraft).

<li>
The second component of file names (the location/platform) must be
<i><b>faam</b></i> in the case of data collected onboard the FAAM aircraft.
<p>
<b>Data file format.</b>
Please format your data in
<a href="/help/formats/netcdf/">NetCDF</a>,
using the CF metadata conventions.
<a href="/help/formats/NASA-Ames/">NASA Ames</a> formatted files are also
accepted.
If you wish to check that files are correctly formatted before uploading them 
please use the <a href="http://titania.badc.rl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/cf-checker.pl">
NetCDF format checker</a> or the BADC

<a href="http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dataex_file.cgi.pl">NASA-Ames format
checker</a>.
Many data files contain the variable <i>time</i> which can be expressed in 
several ways. Guidelines on the <a href="http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/help/formats/NASA-Ames/nasa-ames-time.htm"> 
recommended format of the time-variable</a>  header lines, units and the data values in 
Nasa-Ames files are available and are based on the format used in NetCDF.
<p>
<b>Metadata.</b>
It is important that the data be well documented.
Please follow the BADC guidelines regarding the submission of
<a href="/help/metadata/">metadata</a>.
<p>
<b>Data file submission.</b>

<li>Core data: via the
<a href="/cgi-bin/fileuploader/FAAM_directory_selection">FAAM web uploader</a>
(access restricted to FAAM instrument operators).
<li>Non-core data: via the
<a href="/cgi-bin/fileuploader/ADRIEX_directory_selection">ADRIEX web uploader</a>
