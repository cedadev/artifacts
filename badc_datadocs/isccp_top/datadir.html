  <P>The <A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/CDs/isccpc2/data/">cd-rom data directory</A>
  holds the ISCCP-C2 Monthly Cloud Products for the years 1983
  (beginning July 1983), 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, and
  1990 in separate subdirectories [e.g., (using DOS notation) DATA\1983\].
  The data reside on the disk in their original format, as produced
  by GISS on an IBM computer, except that IBM standard header and
  trailer files from the original product on tape have been removed.<BR>
<BR>
  The first five files in each annual data directory are written
  in ASCII and are arranged in 80-character strings. <BR>
<BR>
  </P>
  <UL>
    <LI>The first file on the original tape is the volume ID file,
    renamed VOLID.TXT in each subdirectory; <BR>
<BR>
    <LI>The second file is the table of contents file, renamed TOC.TXT;
<BR>
<BR>
    <LI>The third file is a READ Program, renamed READPROG.FOR, which
    can be used directly by IBM mainframe users to read, decode,
    and re-map the files; <BR>
<BR>
    <LI>the fourth file holds the conversion tables which convert
    the integer count values to physical quantities, renamed TABLES.TXT;
<BR>
<BR>
    <LI>The fifth file contains geographic and map grid information,
    renamed ANCILARY.TXT on this CD-ROM.

  <P><STRONG>The remaining data files (FILE006.DAT-FILE113.DAT)
  </STRONG>are written as one-byte binary integers and correspond
  to the eight UTC time periods for each month of the year and
  the monthly data for all twelve months. [e.g., FILE006.DAT-FILE013.DAT
  hold values for the hours of 00, 03, 06, 09, 12, 15, 18, and
  21 UTC in January. FILE014.DAT, designated as &quot;ALL&quot;
  in the table of contents file (TOC.TXT), holds monthly mean data.]<BR>
  Please note that the value &quot;255&quot; is used to indicate
  the monthly data in the actual data file. A full year of data
  is held in 108 files.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

  <P><A HREF="var.html">Seventy-two variables</A> are available
  which include temporal and spatial means and standard deviations
  for cloud top pressure and temperature, cloud optical depth,
  and cloud water path. Optical depth, water path, cloud top pressure,
  cloud top temperature, and frequencies are available for low,
  middle, and high clouds and for cumulus, stratus, altocumulus,
  nimbostratus, cirrus, and deep convective clouds. Also offered
  as part of the C2 product are surface reflectance and snow/ice
  cover information. Variables derived from the TIROS Operational
  Vertical Sounder (TOVS) are precipitable water; surface, 500
  mb, tropopause, and stratospheric temperatures; and surface and
  tropopause pressures. Variables derived from visible wavelengths
  are available only during daylight hours.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
