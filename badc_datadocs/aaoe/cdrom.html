          <h3>Introduction</h3> 
      <p>
          This CDROM contains data pertaining to the Airborne Antarctic Ozone 
          Experiment (AAOE) which was based in Punta Arenas, Chile during August 
          and September 1987. The data is primarily that collected onboard the 
          NASA ER-2 and DC-8 aircraft, along with ozonesonde data collected at 
          four Antarctic stations--Halley Bay, McMurdo, Palmer Station, and the 
          South Pole.</p>
        <p>
          All files within this release are standard ASCII files 
          with variable length records. The file naming convention uses a two 
          character prefix to identify the instrument followed by a six digit 
          number giving the year, month, and day (GMT) of the flight (or balloon 
          launch). A three character extension of ER2, DC8, or OZn is used to 
          denote the data is from the ER-2, DC-8, or ozonesonde (OZ1 for the first 
          launch, OZ2 for the second launch on a particular day).</p>

       <h3>Directories</h3>
            
            <UL>
              <LI>The DOCUMENT directory contains several files documenting 
                the contents of this release. </LI>
              <LI>CATALOG.DOC contains a list of the principal investigators, 
                their instruments, measurements, and their addresses. Tables showing 
                the available aircraft data and appropriate file name prefix's 
                are also given.</LI>
              <LI>HALLEY.DOC contains additional information about the 
                ozonesondes launched at Halley Bay, Antarctica.</LI>
              <LI>FORMAT.DOC gives the format specifications which all 
                experimenters were encouraged to use when writing time series 
                data files for data exchange. The standard format includes header 
                information which describes the data, and the data in the form 
                of time series. Some of the measurements (ie. balloon and lidar 
                soundings, and those with nonuniform sampling intervals) are not 
                easily cast as time series with constant sampling intervals so 
                some of the data files have unique formats. But most of the ER-2 
                data files and some of the DC-8 files follow this standard format 
                (with the exception that we have changed the file name extensions 
                from A1 to ER2 or DC8). At least, this document may serve as a 
                guide for reading the data files.</LI>
              <LI>SOFTWARE.DOC contains documentation on Fortran subroutines 
                included in the SOFTWARE directory which can be used to read those 
                files which are in the standard format described in FORMAT.DOC.</Li>
            </UL>
         
        <UL>
          <LI> 2.2 The SOFTWARE directory contains several Fortran subroutines 
            which can be used to read those data files which are in the standard 
            format described in FORMAT.DOC.</LI>
          <BR>
          <BR>
          <LI> 2.3 The DATA directory has three subdirectories for the ER-2, DC-8, 
            and ozonesonde data files. In general, each file contains data for 
            only one flight so the aircraft data is organized by flight date. 
            However, files for the ER-2 Multi Filter Sampler and the DC-8 Fourier 
            Transform Spectrometer and Mark IV Interferometer contain data for 
            all flights in a single file. These exceptions have been placed in 
            MISC subdirectories. The ozonesonde data has been organized by launch 
            site.</LI>
