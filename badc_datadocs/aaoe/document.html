  BASIC Information

  <P>This file contains a basic description of the dataset,
  a list of the files available on the CD ROM and a few references.

  The PIs and their research interests.<A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/CDs/aaoe87/aaoe87/document/catalog.doc">(catalog.doc)</A></H3>
  <P>The following is a list of AAOE '87 Principal Investigators,
  their instruments, principal measurements, and data sample intervals
  (DSI) in seconds. Their addresses are also included.

  The file formats <A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/CDs/aaoe87/aaoe87/document/format.doc">(format.doc)</A></H3>
  <P>This document gives the format specifications which all
  experimenters were encouraged to use when writing time series
  data files for data exchange. The standard format includes header
  information which describes the data, and the data in the form
  of time series. Some of the measurements (ie. balloon and lidar
  soundings, and those with nonuniform sampling intervals) are
  not easily cast as time series with constant sampling intervals
  so some of the data files have unique formats. But most of the
  ER-2 data files and some of the DC-8 files follow this standard
  format (with the exception that the file name extensions have
  been changed). At the very least, this document should serve
  as a guide for reading the data files.

  Halley Bay Ozonesonde ascents <A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/CDs/aaoe87/aaoe87/document/halley.doc">(halley.doc)</A></H3>
  <P>A schedule of Ozonesonde ascents from Halley Bay (76 &deg
  S, 27 &deg W) in 1987, to be used in conjunction with the data
  files on the AAOE CD-ROM.

  The Supplied Software <A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/CDs/aaoe87/aaoe87/document/software.doc">(software.doc)</A></H3>
  <P>Documents the Fortran subroutines included on the CD-ROM
  which can be used to read those files which are in the standard
  format described in the format specification above.</BLOCKQUOTE>
