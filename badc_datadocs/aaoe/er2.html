<P>The NASA ER-2 is a high-altitude, moderate-speed aircraft. 
With a maximum performance altitude of 70,000 feet and a nominal 
performance altitude of 65,000 feet, the NASA ER-2 travels outside 
95 percent of the Earth's atmosphere at approximately 410 knots with 
a range of 3,000 nautical miles.
<P>
The NASA ER-2 aircraft are operated by the High Altitude Missions Branch 
at NASA Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, California.
<P>
As part of NASA's Airborne Science and Applications Program, the NASA ER-2 
aircraft are used to acquire data for Earth science research (e.g., 
agriculture, forestry, hydrology, geology, photogrammetry, oceanography,
 meteorology). These aircraft serve as platforms for a variety of sensors 
that collect data in support of NASA-sponsored scientific projects as well 
as projects involving other federal, State, university, and commercial 
investigators. Data from prototype and operational sensors flown aboard 
NASA ER-2 aircraft are used in applications, including the study of ozone 
depletion, agricultural biospheres, wildlife habitats, and forest wildfires. 
The NASA ER-2 aircraft are part of a fleet of airborne platforms that provide 
support to the Earth Science Enterprise initiative.
