<p>
This document outlines the principles adopted by the
Climate<i>prediction</i>.net project and the British Atospheric Data
Centre (BADC) regarding archival of Climate<i>prediction</i>.net data
at the BADC.  The detailed implementation of these principles will be
further described in the Climate<i>prediction</i>.net Data Management
Plan.
</p>

The aims of the Data Protocol are
<ul>
  <li> to encourage rapid dissemination of scientific results from the
  Climate<i>prediction</i>.net project;</li>
  <li> to protect the rights of the individual scientists collaborating
  on the Climate<i>prediction</i>.net project;</li>
  <li> to ensure the quality of the data and metadata in the
  Climate<i>prediction</i>.net archive.</li>
</ul>

These aims may conflict at times and it is hoped that the provisions of
the protocol resolve these conflicts fairly.  

<ol>
  <li> The designated data centre for the Climate<i>prediction</i>.net project
  is the British Atmospheric Data Centre (BADC).</li>
  <li> All raw data submitted to the BADC will be made available to PI's upon submission.</li>
  <li> Data submitted to the BADC will be periodically validated and incorporated into the
  Climate<i>prediction</i>.net archive in accordance with the Data Management Plan.  The latest
  date by which data must be submitted will be June 30th 2007.</li>
  <li> Access to data within the Climate<i>prediction</i>.net archive will be restricted
  to users given authorisation by a designated Climate<i>prediction</i>.net scientist for
  a period of 2 years after the data is placed in the archive.</li>
  <li> Following the restricted access period (see 4.) data in the Climate<i>prediction</i>.net
  archive will be made freely available to all users.</li>
  <li> Data users are requested to contact a designated Climate<i>prediction</i>.net scientist
  prior to use of any of the data.  Climate<i>prediction</i>.net scientists may request acknowledgement
  (or joint authorship) in any publications based on, using or quoting the data.</li>
  <li> Data submitted to the BADC must be in the data format agreed between
  Climate<i>prediction</i>.net and the BADC (namely NetCDF, where possible conforming to the CF
  metadata standard).  Details of the internal structure of data 
  and metadata are described in the Data Management Plan.  It is the
  responsibility of Climate<i>prediction</i>.net to inform the BADC of any variation in the structure
  of the data or metadata that will impact the validation procedures at the BADC.</li>
  <li> The BADC will produce metadata for each Climate<i>prediction</i>.net simulation to facilitate 
  searching of the archive.  This metadata will be made available to the Climate<i>prediction</i>.net
  project to allow external indexing of the archive.</li>
