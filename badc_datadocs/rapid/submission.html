Rapid Climate Change (RAPID): Data Submission Instructions
</h1>
		<hr>
		<p>The modelling projects funded under RAPID&nbsp;will produce a significant amount of data. These data will be quite varied in nature and volume. In order to make the data available from the BADC&nbsp;archive, the data will need to be either submitted to the BADC&nbsp;by the provider, or collected by the BADC&nbsp;from their system. The actual method used will depend on the dataset itself, but we will attempt to remain as flexible as possible.</p>

Instructions to data providers
</h2>

<p><b>Data file names.</b>  Please provide clear documentation describing the file naming convention used. Model output can often be problematic for non-experts, and a well documentaed dataset will reduce the number of queries directed to the data provider.</p>
<p><b>Data file format.</b> We strongly recommend that you submit  your binary data in <a href="/help/formats/netcdf/">NetCDF</a> format,
  using the CF metadata conventions. <a href="/help/formats/NASA-Ames/">NASA Ames</a> formatted files are also
  accepted for ascii datafiles.
  If you wish to check that files are correctly formatted before uploading them 
  please use the <a href="http://titania.badc.rl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/cf-checker.pl">
  NetCDF format checker</a> or the BADC <a href="http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dataex_file.cgi.pl">NASA-Ames format
      checker</a> for ascii datafiles. </p>
<p><b>Metadata.</b>
  
  It is important that the data be well documented.
  Please follow the BADC guidelines regarding the submission of
  <a href="/help/metadata/">metadata</a>.
  Some standard metadata have to be provided in the data files
  themselves.
  Additional separate documents are welcome.
  </p>
<p><b>Data file submission.</b> In order to upload data files or documents to the BADC, you need to be
  registered with the BADC. A directory will then be created under &quot;incoming&quot;on the BADC ftp server (ftp.badc.rl.ac.uk)  which will allow you to submit data  by ftp (please contact the <a href="mailto:badc@rl.ac.uk">BADC help desk</a> for further information).</p>
