Introduction
</h2>
<p>
The aim of this research is to increase the understanding of the processes that control the distribution of evaporation and precipitation and their difference in the Atlantic region and in particular that the atmosphere gives a net export of water vapour from that basin. This export is vital to the existence and stability of the oceanic thermohaline circulation in the Atlantic. Contrast will be made with the Pacific Ocean region in which the atmosphere imports water. The research will be pursued through detailed analysis of the new ERA-40 data set, fundamental experimentation with an atmospheric GCM and analysis of data sets from climate change experiments.

<p>Project Duration: 1 Nov 2003 - 31 Oct 2006
<P>This project is funded by NERC - Grant Ref. <a href="http://gotw.nerc.ac.uk/list_full.asp?pcode=NER%2FT%2FS%2F2002%2F00441">NER/T/S/2002/00441</a> - through the <a href="http://www.nerc.ac.uk/research/programmes/rapid/">RAPID Climate Change NERC directed mode programme</a>.

Availability of data
</h2>
The project will be looking at ERA-40 reanalysis data, which BADC are already committed to serving. There will be an Atlas produced from the ERA-40 data set, available in November 2003 through the European Centre.
<P>The HadAM3 model will be used in two modes
<ol>
<li> Full climate.
<li>Simplified geometry (aqua planet).
</ol>
<P>
It is unlikely that there will be much interest in the highly idealised aqua planet output for the rest of the RAPID community. However, some of the palaeo projects may be interested in storm tracks and moisture pattern effects and access to the output from the full climate model runs would be useful.
<br>It is possible that a standard set of atmospheric diagnostics will be applied to other models such as HadCM3, HadGEM and HiGEM
