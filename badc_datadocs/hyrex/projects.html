<HR ALIGN=LEFT>

<H2>1. Design of radar/raingauge networks for hydrological use</H2>

<P><B>Principal Investigators:</B> R.J. Moore, CEH Wallingford (formerly 
Institute of Hydrology),
Crowmarsh Gifford, Wallingford, Oxon, OX10 8BB.</P>

<P><B>Aims:</B> The aim of the project is to review the requirements
for rainfall field estimates in the hydrological sciences and
to establish how these can be best met using networks of radars
and raingauges.</P>

<P><B>Methodology and approach:</B> A unique dataset collected from a
dense network of raingauges and radars will be subject to statistical
analysis and physical interpretation to better understand (i)
the accuracy of different sensors to measure rainfall and (ii)
the sensitivity of catchment flow models to rainfall uncertainty
and variability.</P>

<P><B>Start and end date:</B> 1/4/93 to 31/3/96</P>

<H2>2. Spatial-Temporal Rainfall fields: Modelling and Statistical
Aspects</H2>

<P><B>Principal Investigators:</B> Prof H.S. Wheater, Civil Engineering
Dept., Imperial College, London SW7 2BU; Prof. V. Isham, Statistical
Science Dept., University College, London WC1E 6BT and Prof Sir
David Cox, F.R.S., Nuffield College, Oxford OX1 1NF.</P>

<P><B>Aims:</B> Analysis and modelling of spatial rainfall to provide
an improved statistical basis for hydrological applications; provision
of general statistical advice to the HYREX programme.</P>

<P><B>Methodology and approach:</B> Following preliminary analysis of
HYREX and related data, further development and implementation
of spatial-temporal rainfall models will be undertaken and evaluation
of their hydrological applications.</P>

<P><B>Start and end date:</B> 1/4/93 to 19/5/97</P>

<H2>3. The development of a stochastic space-time rainfall forecasting
system for real-time flow forecasting</H2>

<P><B>Principal Investigators:</B> Prof P.E. O'Connell and Dr A.V. Metcalfe,
Department of Civil Engineering, Cassie Building, University of
Newcastle upon Tyne, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE1 7RU.</P>

<P><B>Aims:</B> To develop the Modified Turning Bands (MTB) Model for
space-time rainfall into a forecasting system, and to optimize
the technique with respect to the accuracy of a catchment response
forecast.</P>

<P><B>Methodology and approach:</B> After conditionally fitting a synthetic
rainstorm as produced by the MTB Model to current radar data,
the model will be run forwards in time to simulate future events,
and thereby produce a rainfall forecast in time and space. Catchment
modelling systems (SHE and ARNO) will be used as test-beds for
assessing the performance of the technique.</P>

<P><B>Start and end date:</B> 1/4/93 to 31/3/96</P>

<H2>4. Methods for short-period precipitation and flow forecasting
incorporating radar data</H2>

<P><B>Principal Investigators:</B> Prof A.J. Thorpe and Dr M.A. Pedder,
JCMM, University of Reading, 2 Earley Gate, Whiteknights, Reading,
RG6 2AU; and Mr R.J. Moore, CEH Wallingford, Crowmarsh
Gifford, Wallingford, Oxon, OX10 8BB.</P>

<P><B>Aims:</B> To develop techniques for the assimilation of radar data
into mesoscale and finer scale meteorological models and to investigate
their conjunctive use with hydrological models for rainfall and
flow forecasting.</P>

<P><B>Methodology and approach:</B> The aims will be achieved through
(i) the use of 4D data assimilation techniques, (ii) the development
of a high resolution rainfall model incorporating simple process
descriptions and data assimilation, and (iii) an assessment of
the rainfall model predictions in hydrological catchment models,
with reference to observed rainfall, soil moisture and flow data.</P>

<P><B>Start and end date:</B> 1/11/93 to 31/10/96</P>

<H2>5. Verification of polarisation radar techniques for improving
estimates of rainfall</H2>

<P><B>Principal Investigators:</B> Dr A.J. Illingworth, University of
Reading, 2 Earley Gate, Whiteknights, Reading, RG6 2AU. Mr J.W.F.
Goddard, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Chilton, Didcot, Oxon,
OX11 0QX.</P>

<P><B>Aims:</B> To quantify how polarisation radar parameters (especially
differential phase shift) can improve rainfall estimates for hydrological
purposes; to investigate these techniques for removing clutter
and correcting for the bright band.</P>

<P><B>Methodology and approach:</B> To gather polarisation radar data
with the Chilbolton radar, to compare inferred rain rates with:
(i) a line of rapid response gauges close to the radar, and (on
the same azimuth); (ii) gauges over the Brue catchment; (iii)
in-situ particle measurements on the C-130 aircraft.</P>

<P><B>Start and end date:</B> 1/4/93 to 31/3/96</P>

<H2>6. Radar Hydrometeorology, using a vertically pointing radar</H2>

<P><B>Principal Investigators:</B> Prof I.D. Cluckie and Dr K.A. Tilford,
Department of Civil Engineering, University of Salford, Salford
M5 4WT</P>

<P><B>Aims:</B> To study the hydrometeorology of rainfall systems in
orographic and non-orographic regions with a high resolution vertical
pointing radar.</P>

<P><B>Methodology and approach:</B> To deploy at least two high resolution
vertically pointing X-band radars to obtain vertical reflectivity
profiles of rainfall systems. A transect experiment will study
orographic effects.</P>

<P><B>Start and end date:</B> 1/3/93 to 29/2/96</P>
