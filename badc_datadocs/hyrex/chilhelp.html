<P>This document describes the HYREX experimental dataset from
the Chilbolton radar. There are separate documents describing
the <A HREF="umhelp.html">Unified Model</A> data, the <A HREF="comhelp.html">common
infrastructure dataset</A> and the <A HREF="salhelp.html">vertically
pointing radar</A> and associated datasets supplied by the University
of Salford.</P>

<P>The Chilbolton radar data and an associated set of raingauge
data are available from John Goddard of the CLRC's <A HREF="http://www.rcru.rl.ac.uk/chil/welcome.htm"
TARGET="_top">Radio Communications Research Unit</A> (RCRU). This
dataset is considered to be sufficiently specialised that interested
users should contact the RCRU for help on obtaining and using
the data.</P>

<H2>Radar data</H2>

<P>The Chilbolton data are distributed on CD-ROM. So far there
are 5 CDs incorporating approx. 3Gbytes of data in total:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Time coverage 8th April '94 - 12th March '96. A further year's
  data is not yet available on CD.
  <LI>Time resolution: the scan cycle is repeated at 15 minute
  intervals.
  <LI>Time coverage: typically 1 day per file.
  <LI>The data are stored in binary files, not zipped.
  <LI>File sizes are between 1 and 10 MBytes.
</UL>

<P>Other information: Software is not available with the data,
however an IDL display/analysis program or FORTRAN subroutines
can be obtained from John Goddard of the RCRU.</P>

<H2>Raingauge data</H2>

<P>Also available from RCRU is a CD of raingauge data, from 7
gauges in line west of Chilbolton. Coverage is April 1994 - Jan
1997, with 30 second integration times. A total of about 300MB
data are stored in ASCII files. IDL software to read the data
is available through John Goddard of the RCRU.</P>
