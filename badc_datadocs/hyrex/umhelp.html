<H2>1. Introduction</H2>

<P>This document describes the UK Met. Office Unified Model data
for the HYREX project. There are separate dataset descriptions
for the <A HREF="comhelp.html">common infrastructure dataset</A>,
the <A HREF="salhelp.html">vertically pointing radar</A> and associated
datasets supplied by the University of Salford, and for the <A
HREF="chilhelp.html">Chilbolton radar data</A>.</P>

<P>This dataset comprises a set of Mesoscale Model forecast data
outputs for some of the HYREX Intensive Observing Periods (IOP's),
of which there have been 11 to date. The data have been generated
by the Joint Centre for Mesoscale Meteorology (JCMM) at Reading
University. </P>

<H3><A NAME="Model"></A>1.1 The UK Mesoscale Model</H3>

<P>The UK Meteorological Office Operational Numerical Weather
Prediction (NWP) can be configured to run the Global Model, the
Limited Area Model (LAM) or the Mesoscale Model (MM). The MM is
designed to supply finer scale weather information for the UK
up to one day forecast time. As the main aim of the MM is to predict
weather elements rather than the large scale flow patterns, conditions
near the surface and the moisture distribution are important.
Surface observations of temperature, humidity and wind over land
are at present assimilated only in the MM. In addition, Meteosat
infrared imagery, radar rainfall imagery and surface cloud reports
are combined with the latest 3 hour model forecast in MOPS, the
Moisture Observation Pre-processing System. The output from MOPS
(cloud fraction) is converted into a set of relative humidity
soundings at each model grid-point, which are then assimilated
in the MM.</P>

<P>The UK operational Mesoscale model uses a rotated latitude
and longitude coordinate system in which the computational north
pole is shifted to an actual position of 37.5 deg. N, 177.5 E.
This is done to obtain fairly uniform horizontal resolution over
the area of interest. The corners of the computational area are
approximately in actual latitude/longitude: (60.1N, 16.6W; 60.2N,
10.7E; 46.6N, 12.7W; 46.7N, 7.1E). The grid-length is 0.15 deg.
in each direction which is approximately 16.8 Km, giving 92x92
grid points running from the north - west corner. In the vertical
the MM uses hybrid sigma/pressure coordinates and has 31 levels
with the first 28 of these being moist levels. The lower levels
are based upon sigma levels, defined as pressure/surface pressure
ratio implying that they closely follow the terrain and the upper
levels are defined on pressure levels.</P>

<P>The MM is hydrostatic (the basic equations assume that vertical
accelerations are small enough to be ignored compared to gravity)
and uses a B-grid staggering, i.e the variables are held on the
Arakawa `B' grid. In the Arakawa B grid scheme, potential temperature
(<EM>theta</EM>), surface pressure (<EM>p<SUP>*</SUP></EM>) and
specific humidity (<EM>q</EM>) etc. are calculated on grid points
but the two horizontal wind components (<EM>u,v</EM>) are calculated
in the centre of the grid boxes. The variables <EM>u, v, theta,
q </EM>and <EM>Z </EM>(Geopotential Height) are held at levels
<EM>eta<SUB>k</SUB></EM>, where <EM>eta</EM> is the vertical height
coordinate and <EM>k</EM> is the vertical grid index, while the
time derivative <EM>eta dot</EM> is held at the intermediate levels
<EM>eta<SUB>(k+1/2)</SUB></EM>.</P>

<H3>1.2 Research with the data at the JCMM</H3>

<P>The research effort at the Reading JCMM is to make detailed
analyses of MM data obtained during Intensive Observation Periods
(IOP's). The main tool used in this research is the UK Meteorological
Office Mesoscale Model (MM), which is a particular configuration
of the Unified Model (UM). For each IOP, the model is run with
initial data identical to that used in the operational forecast
model runs, obtained from the Met Office. The model runs consist
of specific case studies of forecast durations between 6 and 24
hours and correspond to the IOP periods. The model is run with
and without Observational Data Assimilation to see how the inclusion
of extra upper air sounding data affect the moisture budget calculations.
</P>

<P>One of the aims of the research at Reading with these data
is to use the wind and humidity fields from the MM in the moisture
budget equation. During the IOP's, estimates of the volume-averaged
atmospheric moisture flux convergence affecting southern England
are obtained. The area for which the moisture budget is estimated
will be varied systematically in order to define the lower limits
in space and time for which the moisture budget equation provides
a realistic prediction of observed precipitation. In each case
the relative importance of the different terms in the equation
is being examined.</P>

<P>In order to verify the moisture budget, areal averages of rainfall
are obtained from analysis of rainguage data made by IOH and then
compared with the results from the model.</P>

<H2>2. The UM data</H2>

<H3><A NAME="Fields"></A>2.1 Model output data fields</H3>

<P>The output data from each model run include a variety of field
types, which are written to 3 output files labelled .pp0, .pp1
and .pp2 (referred to in the &quot;Usage Profile&quot; column
in the table below). There are single level and multi-level fields:
multi-level fields are written on both model and pressure levels.
The following table shows the distribution of data fields between
the three files. This table is also available as a plain-text
file called <EM>FieldCodes.txt</EM> in the documentation directory
<EM>/badc/hyrex/doc/um</EM>.</P>

<P>Note that all winds are held on the U-grid. The U and V winds
on Pressure levels are true Westerly and Southerly wind components
but all other winds are orientated with the model grid.</P>

<P>The Time Profiles indicate the times at which the variables
are written out:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>T15MA - Accumulated field. Accumulating interval: 1 Timestep,
  Accumulating every: 1 Timestep. Data output at regular intervals
  - Starting at 3, outputting every 3 Timesteps, ending at end
  of run.
  <LI>T15MR - Single time field. Data output at regular intervals.
  Diagnostics output at Timesteps: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, etc. in steps
  of 3 until the end of the run.
</UL>

<P>All of the diagnostics are output from the model at the end
of a time step unless explicitly stated, e.g. there are some temp
fields at intermediate stages of the time step: temp after LS
Precip or temp after convection, with the LS Precip and convection
referring to stages during a time-step.</P>

<P>The Domain Profiles indicate the spatial characteristics of
the output variables:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>DS - Single level.
  <LI>DM - Variables on atmospheric model levels/half levels. Variables
  over a range of model levels from: 1 (bottom level), to: 31 (top
  level).
  <LI>DMW - Variables on atmospheric model levels/half levels.
  Variables over a range of model levels from: 1 (bottom level),
  to: 28 (top wet level).
  <LI>DP - Variables on pressure levels (level values listed under
  Vertical Coverage)
</UL>

<P>The Usage Profiles simply indicate to which PP file the particular
output variable is written.</P>

<P>*** WARNING! There is a problem with one of the UM diagnostics
due to a bug in the then current version (V3.4) of the UM. This
means that field 16225 &quot;Geopotential height of model levels&quot;
is wrong. The orography was added to this field twice by mistake.
Orography data is available from the directory <EM>/badc/hyrex/data/um</EM>
to allow for correction of this problem.</P>

<P>N.B. Where the ending time is before the starting time, this
means that the run ended the following day. Model runs 1-4 are
not included as they were not part of the HYREX project. Further

<H3><A NAME="UMfiles"></A>3.1 The UM data files</H3>

<P>The UM data is output into 3 files per model run, which range
in size between 80 and 480 Mbytes. (The filenames are tabulated
under 'Temporal Coverage' above). These are IEEE binary files
in Met. Office &quot;PP&quot; format, consisting of unpacked headers
(mostly integer data) followed by floating point field data.</P>

<P>Data are compressed using gzip to save disk space.

<H3>3.2 Software to read the data</H3>

<P>Software to read and plot the um data is available at: <A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/hyrex/software/um/">/badc/hyrex/software/um/</a>.

<P>As mentioned above, the UM data are stored in very large binary
files, so software is required to read the files and extract the
fields of interest. JCMM have provided a UNIX shell script <EM>exfield</EM>,
which runs a FORTRAN program to read the data and extract required
fields. Both are available in the directory <EM>/badc/hyrex/software/um</EM>.
There are versions of the software for Cray (<EM>sort_cray.f</EM>)
and IEEE (Sun etc - <EM>sort_ieee.f</EM>) platforms. The software
has also been run on the BADC's DEC UNIX machine login.badc.rl.ac.uk, by compiling
with the -convert big_endian qualifier to the f77 compiler as
follows:</P>

<PRE>
$ f77 -o sort.x -convert big_endian sort_ieee.f</PRE>

<P>(Comparisons of sample data values on login.badc.rl.ac.uk and a Sun machine
showed the same data values were output on both systems, so the
floating point values are successfully &quot;byte-swapped&quot;
on the DEC system.) You can use the exfield software to extract
subsets of data on login.badc.rl.ac.uk, ready for FTP to your local system. Note 
that you may need to ask <a href="/help/contact.html">BADC Support</a> for an account on login.badc.rl.ac.uk to 
process the data files before transferring the data to your local machine.</P>

<P>Using exfield you can select fields by their field code, select
a sub-area from the model grid by specifying the latitude and
longitude limits (as grid array indices), select specific pressure
or model levels or ranges of levels, and specify the data output
times or frequency (as dump time indices). The program produces
an output file containing header information such as pressure
levels and field codes contained in the model run data, and writes
the selected data fields to a PP format file.</P>

<P>If you want to use exfield to extract subsets of data on login.badc.rl.ac.uk,
you need to copy the exfield shell script to your private filestore
and edit it to select the data you require. However, there is
no need to copy the sort executable - you can set up an alias
to use the copy in the software directories.</P>

<H3><A NAME="Plot"></A>3.3 Software to manipulate and plot the
data</H3>

<P>JCMM have provided a program called <EM>JPLOT</EM> to manipulate
and plot the output data from the exfield read and subsetting
software. JPLOT can be found in the software/um directory. JPLOT is a fully-interactive X-windows widget based
IDL graphical display program, designed to run on IEEE UNIX systems.
It is intended to handle data from a variety of sources including
UM data extractions.</P>

<P>JPLOT can display data in a number of ways:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Any arbitrary 2D orthogonal section through a 3D field.
  <LI>Oblique vertical sections from one cell to another.
  <LI>Any arbitrary orthogonal &quot;column/row of points&quot;
  producing an x-y line plot.
  <LI>Velocity vector plots (which may be overplotted) assuming
  U and V winds are present.
  <LI>3D Iso-surface plots.
</UL>

<P>The user can then display the 2D sections in a number of ways,
for example using images, contours or surface plots. Also various
tool are available such as zoom utilities and other data field
manipulation widgets. UM data may be displayed either on a rectangle
corresponding to the equatorial grid (which the limited area models
are run on) or with a standard cylindrical map projection. An
overplotting facility also exists for plotting one field over
another. The user can interactively alter various display parameters
such as contouring parameters (values, linestyles, labelling, etc.)
and axis values and titles etc. PostScript files can be created
for hardcopies of graphical output.</P>
<P>More information about <a href="http://www.met.rdg.ac.uk/~uwern/jplot/">JPLOT</a> is available from the JCMM website.
