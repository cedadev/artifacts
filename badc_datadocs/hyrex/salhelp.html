<H2>1. Introduction</H2>

<P>This document describes the University of Salford data from
the HYREX project. There are separate dataset descriptions for
the <A HREF="comhelp.html">common infrastructure dataset</A>,
the <A HREF="umhelp.html">UKMO Unified Model data</A> supplied
by JCMM, and for the <A HREF="chilhelp.html">Chilbolton radar
data</A>.</P>

<H3><A NAME="Background"></A>1.1 Background to the Salford project</H3>

<H4>Hydrometeorological studies using a Vertically Pointing Radar</H4>

<P>The primary focus of this research project was to commission
and deploy a mobile X band Vertically Pointing Radar (VPR) in
the HYREX project area to support a high resolution study into
the hydrometeorology of local rainfall systems. Of particular
significance was an examination of the problems of bright band
contamination of quantitative rainfall measurements from scanning
weather radars. Large errors can result from the transmitted microwave
intersecting water coated ice crystals at and immediately below
the melting layer and thus generating larger reflected signals
than would arise from ordinary raindrops.</P>

<P>The research programme was designed to further the understanding
of bright band characteristics and dynamism and support the development
of algorithms capable of modelling the consequences of variations
in the vertical reflectivity profile on quantitative precipitation
measurements. Hence the VPR data were integrated with other HYREX
data sources including the Chilbolton, Cobbacombe and Wardon Hill
radars as well as the Salford low-cost C band MARS data (see Cluckie
et al., 1995). The use of additional VPRs (one mobile and one
located at the University of Salford) provided an opportunity
to investigate the spatial variability of bright band characteristics
through a number of transect experiments in north west England
and via deployment in areas covered by the Chilbolton radar. Ground
truth measurements were obtained from Transportable Weather Stations
(TWS) and two drop counting raingauges (hydragauges) deployed
alongside the VPRs. Data were also obtained from an acoustic radar
and a disdrometer. Additional rainfall measurements from the dense
raingauge network in the Brue catchment were also used.</P>

<H2>2. Dataset descriptions, spatial and temporal coverage</H2>

<H3><A NAME="VPR"></A>2.1 Vertically Pointing Radars</H3>

<P>Three VPRs were used during the course of the project. Technical
specifications may be found in Cluckie et al. (1992). For the
period May - December 1994 data were collected in the north west
of England from one device located at the University of Salford
and two mobile devices which were deployed locally either at Warrington
and Fazakerley or Davyhulme and Audenshaw (see Tilford et al.,
1995). These combinations covered ranges of 43 and 17 kilometres
respectively. From April - December the two mobile VPRs were operated
in the HYREX region. <A HREF="#Availability">Section 2.6</A> details
the availability of all instrumentation operated by the Salford
group during the HYREX period.</P>

<P>The VPR data consist of vertical reflectivity profiles at a
resolution of 7.5 m and 4 seconds, and the files can be read using
software available from Salford. The data quality is somewhat
variable due to hardware and software modifications made during
the course of the project and the unattended operation of the
radars. No attempt has been made to quality control these data
sets except in the case of specific events analysed by the Salford
Group.</P>

<H3><A NAME="TWS"></A>2.2 Transportable Weather Stations</H3>

<P>TWSs are operated alongside each of the VPRs and the availability
of the data from these is outlined in Table 1. The stations record
rainfall (0.1 mm tips) wind speed and direction, pressure, wet
and dry bulb temperatures, humidity and net and solar radiation,
all with a temporal resolution of 2 minutes.</P>

<H3><A NAME="Hydra"></A>2.3 Hydragauges</H3>

<P>The Hydragauge is a high resolution raingauge developed by
the Atmospheric Physics Group, University of Auckland (Stow, 1993).
The device operates by producing near-constant-size drops which
are counted during a switch-selected time interval to give the
rainfall rate. The nominal calibration of 160 drops per mm enables
the gauge to measure rainfall intensities of up to approximately
200 mm per hr.</P>

<H3><A NAME="Dis"></A>2.4 Disdrometer</H3>

<P>An RD-69 disdrometer (Joss and Waldvogel, 1970) was loaned
by J.Goddard of Rutherford Appleton Laboratory for deployment
alongside a VPR and the acoustic radar. The device records drop
sizes over a range of 0.3 - 5.0 mm and stores data as the number
of drops in each of 20 approximately exponentially distributed
drop size classes over the given range. For the purposes of this
study the temporal resolution was set to 1 minute.</P>

<H3><A NAME="AR"></A>2.5 Acoustic Radar</H3>

<P>The Auckland acoustic profiler (Bradley and George, 1994) transmits
an 8l beam at 4250 Hz, 4300 Hz or 4350 Hz sine wave for 0.075
s from a 150 W array of 37 piezo-electric tweeters. These are
then used as microphones for approximately 2 s which enables the
signal reflected from inhomogeneities up to an altitude of 340
m to be observed. The returned signal is amplified and sampled
at 10 bit resolution at a rate of 572 Hz over 20 m range gates.</P>

<A NAME="Using"><H2>3. Data Quality and Restrictions of Use</H2></A>

<P>Data analysis has been restricted to a number of individual
storm events and consequently no general quality control measures
have been undertaken. The use of any of the Salford datasets should
be made with this in mind. Some guidance can be given as regards
instrument failure and any potential error sources found during
the course of routine maintenance. Most of the data held by Salford
can be made available to any interested third parties although
the use of VPR data by other researchers should be undertaken
in collaboration with the Water Resources Research Group because
of the technical issues detailed earlier.</P>

<H2>4. Obtaining and using data from the BADC</H2>

<P>The BADC holds the ancillary data, i.e. hydraguage and transportable
weather station (TWS) files, plus image files of the radar data.
Researchers wishing to use the data are encouraged to liaise with
the PI group.</P>

<P>These data are world-readable, so they can be obtained via
WWW from <A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/hyrex/data/Salford/">http://www.badc.rl.ac.uk/badc/hyrex/data/salford/</A>
or by FTP (Note that you will need to register as a BADC/NEODC user before using this service - connect to <EM>ftp.ceda.ac.uk</EM>,
log in with username and password and cd to directory <EM>badc/hyrex/data/salford</EM>).</P>

<P>The help file <A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/hyrex/data/Salford/readme.txt">readme.txt</A>
gives details of file formats and contents. The hydragauge and
TWS data are in ASCII files, while the radar images are held in
GIF files.</P>
