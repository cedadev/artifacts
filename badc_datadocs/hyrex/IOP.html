<H2>IOP1: 18 Oct 94 (21Z) - 19 Oct(21Z)</H2>

<P>A slow - moving low was situated to the west of Ireland with
a long trailing front which made slow progress eastwards over
the period. Rainfall was greater over northern Britain but a band
of precipitation passed over Southern England with rainfall over
the Brue early on the 19th October. There was evidence of a short
warm front close to the more notable occluded (or cold) front,
complicating the interpretation of rainfall patterns over southern
UK. Rainfall was mainly stratiform in character but with embedded
small-scale (probably) convective showers. Over the Brue a total
accumulated rainfall of about 6 mm was recorded.</P>

<H2>IOP2: 04 Dec 94 (21Z) - 05 Dec(21Z)</H2>

<P>Early on the 5th Dec a low centre deepened by 12 mb in 12 hours
as it approached western Europe. The low centre tracked north
of Ireland to lie between Iceland and Scotland early on the 6th
Dec. A long trailing cold front passed over the UK rapidly during
the afternoon of the 5th Dec. There were squally blustery showers
behind the cold front and it was notably windy over this period.
The front was oriented north-south and progressed steadily eastwards
over the Brue catchment. The daytime rainfall (over 12 hours )
was typically 12 mm in the south-west peninsula. Over the Brue
catchment the accumulated mean rainfall was 8 mm.</P>

<H2>IOP3: 06 Dec 94 (12Z) - 07 Dec(12Z)</H2>

<P>Late on the 6th Dec a low deepened rapidly (22 mb in 12 hours)
as it approached western Europe. At 12 Z on the 7th Dec the central
pressure was 940 mb and it lay to the south of Iceland. The triple
point passed over the Channel, lying just south of the Brue at
00 Z on the 7th Dec. During the night of the 6/7th Dec rainfall
passed over the Brue catchment. It was heavy in places in the
UK and was accompanied by gales. Places in Cornwall recorded over
20 mm rainfall over a 24 hour period. There were blustery showers
following the frontal passage. Over the Brue catchment the accumulated
mean rainfall was 9 mm.</P>

<H2>IOP4: 14 Feb 95 (06Z) - 14 Feb(18Z)</H2>

<P>A small area of low pressure progressed towards western Scotland
during the 14th Feb. There was little development over this period.
Southern England experienced the passage of a weak warm front
followed by a more marked cold front. Rainfall in the south-west
peninsula began at 12 Z with daytime rainfall (over 12 hours)
in places amounting to 17 mm. It was an exceptionally mild day
over England (maxima around 12 degrees C). Over the Brue catchment
the accumulated mean rainfall was 6 mm.</P>

<H2>IOP5: 26 Feb 95 (21Z) - 27 Feb(21Z)</H2>

<P>No rainfall over the UK. This IOP was used for some flights
of the C-130 aircraft.</P>

<H2>IOP6: 10 Jul 95</H2>

<P>Overnight 9/10 July much of the country had a fine night with
some low cloud and mist. In the south west of England there was
more cloud with thunderstorms in parts of Dorset and Devon. During
the day the southwest continued to have thundery showers, heavy
in places and these gradually extended into Wales and parts of
central England in the afternoon of the 10th July. In Clwyd 48
mm were recorded over a 24 hour period. Near the Brue area, places
recorded 7 mm over 12 hours of the daytime of the 10th July. These
showers were associated with troughs passing over England. These
were associated with an extended and complex area of low pressure
stretching from west of Ireland into France.</P>

<H2>IOP7: 26 Jul 95</H2>

<P>Thunderstorms started around 0 Z on 26 July over the Channel
Islands and then spread northwards reaching Devon and Cornwall
before dawn. These storms continued to spread to the Bristol Channel
soon after dawn and then moved eastwards reaching southern England
by mid-morning and London by midday. In the afternoon the showers
in the west were dying out although the southwest stayed cloudy
with the odd shower. These storms were associated with the northward
progression of a warm front linked to a low lying to the south
of Ireland. Behind the front there were two troughs which passed
over north-west France.</P>

<H2>IOP9: 6 Sep 95 (09Z) - 7 Sep(03Z)</H2>

<P>During 6th Sept a compact low approached the south-western
tip of the UK deepening rapidly (16 mb in 12 hours). By 18 Z it
lay to the south-west of Ireland. Rainfall over the south-west
was in association with the approaching warm front and triple
point. Rainfall was heavy during the evening of the 6th Sept.</P>
