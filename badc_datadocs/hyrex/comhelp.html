<H2>1. Introduction</H2>

<P>This dataset comprises data gathered from instruments, located
in and around the HYREX experimental catchment, that constitute
a common infrastructure providing data for use by all HYREX projects.
The data are made available to HYREX researchers via a central
archive maintained by the CEH Wallingford (formerly the Institute of Hydrology (IH)). 

<P>The <A HREF="umhelp.html">Unified Model</A> data, the <A HREF="salhelp.html">vertically
pointing radar</A> and associated datasets supplied by the University
of Salford, and <A HREF="chilhelp.html">Chilbolton radar</A> data
are described in separate documents.</P>

<H3><A NAME="Catchment"></A>1.1 The HYREX experimental catchment</H3>

<P>The River Brue catchment in Somerset, south-west England, drains
an area of 132 sq. km to its river gauging station at Lovington.
The catchment is predominantly rural and of modest relief, with
spring-fed headwaters rising in the Mendip Hills and Salisbury
Plain. Clays, sands and oolites give rise to a responsive flow
regime. The catchment is scanned continuously by two Met. Office
network C-band radars, one at Wardon Hill and the other at Cobbacombe
Cross (Doppler), located at ranges of circa 40 and 70 km from
the centre of the catchment respectively. The radars record data
from the lowest elevation scan at 5 minute intervals for a 2 km
grid out to a range of 75 km. Data for a 5 km grid out to a range
of 210 km are available for four scan elevations, including the
lowest one. A third radar, at Chilbolton in Hampshire at a range
of about 75 km, is deployed during special intense observing periods
and provides a Doppler dual polarisation S-band capability.</P>

<H3><A NAME="Infrastructure"></A>1.2 Experimental infrastructure</H3>

<P>The common experimental infrastructure comprises the national
network radars at Wardon Hill and Cobbacombe Cross, a purpose-built
dense raingauge network, an automatic weather station (AWS), an
automatic soil water station (ASWS) and a river gauging station.
This part of the infrastructure was provided by the Meteorological
Office, the Environment Agency, the Natural Environment Research
Council, and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF).
These instruments have provided a continuous record throughout
HYREX. A disdrometer, operated
by CEH Wallingford, was deployed during selected Intense
Observing Periods.</P>

<H3><A NAME="Research"></A>1.3 Research using the data within
HYREX</H3>

<P>CEH Wallingford was responsible for the quality
control of the dense raingauge network as part of its project
concerned with the accuracy of radar/raingauge networks. It also
made use of disdrometer data to better understand how the relation
between radar reflectivity and rain-rate was affected by the raindrop
size distribution.</P>

<P>The University of London consortium were also major users of
the dense raingauge network in the context of carrying out basic
statistical analyses of both raingauge and radar data. Their primary
interest lay in the use of the network weather radar data for
modelling the space-time structure of rainfall field for hydrological
design applications.</P>

<P>The University of Newcastle employed both the dense raingauge
data and network radar data for developing and evaluating a stochastic
space-time rainfall forecasting system; they also used catchment
flow data to develop a rainfall-runoff model for the catchment
in order to convert forecasts of rain to flow.</P>

<P>CEH Wallingford, in collaboration with JCMM, used
multi-scan network radar data (along with Unified Model output
data) in their development of a storm model for short-term rainfall
forecasting.</P>

<H2>2. Instruments and data</H2>

<P>The HYREX instruments and the data they record are described
below, along with comments on additional derived data and data
quality information. The format and content of data files are
summarised briefly, and full details of data records and fields
may be found in the file <A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/hyrex/data/Common/FORMATS">/badc/hyrex/data/Common/FORMATS</A>.
The data files themselves are located in the various instrument
subdirectories of <A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/hyrex/data/Common/">/badc/hyrex/data/Common</A>.</P>

<H3><A NAME="Weathrad"></A>2.1 Weather radar</H3>

<P>The Wardon Hill and Cobbacombe Cross radars operate at the
C-band wavelengths that are standard for the UK weather radar
network. Each radar completes one azimuthal scan every minute,
and cycles through 4 different scan elevations (0.5, 1.0, 1.5
and 2.5 degrees) every 5 minutes. Software at the radar site converts
measurements of reflectivity on a radial grid into measurements
of rainfall intensity on two Cartesian grids: an 84x84 grid of
5km square pixels covering a radius of 210km and a 76x76 grid
of 2km square pixels covering a radius of 76km. Rainfall intensity
is digitised into 208 levels ranging semi-logarithmically from
1/32 to 126 mm/h. Only the Cartesian-grid rainfall intensity data
are recorded, with data available for all scan elevations on the
5km grid, but only for the lowest scan (&quot;beam 0&quot;) on
the 2km grid. The Brue catchment lies within the 2km grid for
both radars.</P>

<P>There is one instrument directory for each radar (<A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/hyrex/data/Common/war/">war</A>
and <A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/hyrex/data/Common/cob/">cob</A>). The image data are stored in ASCII files, one
file per radar per day, in the order in which they were observed.
The data files have names constructed from the date and radar
name, such as 19950425_war_ih or 19941105_cob_ih (the ih suffix
indicates that the files are in the format used by CEH Wallingford, formerly the Institute
of Hydrology), and are located in monthly directories within each
instrument directory (e.g. <EM>war/9504</EM> or <EM>cob/9411</EM>).
For each data file there is a corresponding log file (suffix <EM>lg</EM>)
that lists the images and other data contained in the data file.
A FORTRAN subroutine, <EM>readri.f</EM>, is provided that will
read a specified image from a given data file into a FORTRAN array.</P>

<P>Each instrument directory has a QUALITY subdirectory, containing
text files of information related to data quality. In particular,
the files named <EM>missing.txt</EM> summarise periods of missing
data.</P>

<P>The radar data have been used to calculate catchment-average
rainfall over 15-minute and daily accumulation periods. These
data are held in the directory <A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/hyrex/data/Common/catch_avgs/radar/">catch_avgs/radar</A>.

<H3>2.2 Dense raingauge network</H3>

<P>The dense raingauge network comprises 49 Cassella 0.2mm tipping
bucket raingauges, each recording time of tip to a time resolution
of 10 seconds. The network provides at least one raingauge in
each of the 2km radar grid squares that lie entirely within the
catchment. In addition, there are two parallel lines of greater
gauge density extending SW to NE across the catchment, aligned
with the prevailing wind direction and running from lowland to
upland. Within each line there is one 2km grid square containing
a super-dense sub-network of 8 raingauges arranged in a square-within-a-diamond
configuration, with one sub-network in a lowland area and the
other in an upland area.</P>

<P>The raingauges are identified by four-letter abbreviations;
details and locations of the raingauge sites may be found in the
instrument directory <A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/hyrex/data/Common/drn/">drn</A>.
The data are held in monthly files with names such as <EM>9407_drn</EM>
or <EM>9511_drn</EM>. Each file lists all tips from all gauges,
listed in alphabetical order of raingauge abbreviation, and chronologically
within each gauge.</P>

<P>The <A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/hyrex/data/Common/drn/QUALITY/">drn/QUALITY</A>
directory contains two text files, one listing all the known or
inferred faults with each raingauge, and the other summarising
the periods for which each raingauge is considered to provide
valid data. There is also a Microsoft Excel file, <EM>download.xls</EM>,
containing summary totals and notes made on each occasion that
data were downloaded from the raingauge loggers.</P>

<P>The raingauge data and quality information have been used to
calculate catchment-average rainfall over 15-minute and daily
accumulation periods. These data are held in the directory
<A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/hyrex/data/Common/catch_avgs/raingauge/">catch_avgs/raingauge</A>.</P>

<H3><A NAME="AWS"></A>2.3 Automatic weather and soil water stations</H3>

<P>An automatic weather station (AWS) and automatic soil water
station (ASWS) are located close to the Bridge Farm raingauge
in the lowland sub-network. The AWS records solar and net radiation,
wet and dry bulb temperature, wind speed and direction, atmospheric
pressure and rainfall (0.2mm tip) every 15 minutes, and also records
daily totals or averages. The ASWS makes hourly capacitance probe,
pressure transducer and temperature measurements at three depths,
along with rainfall (0.5mm tip).</P>

<P>The data are held in yearly files within each instrument directory
<A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/hyrex/data/Common/aws/">aws</A> or <A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/hyrex/data/Common/asws/">asws</A>).
AWS and ASWS data file formats are very similar, differing only
in the number and interpretation of the data fields on each line.
The files of ASWS hourly data have names of the form <EM>95_brfm</EM>;
the AWS 15-minute data files are of the form <EM>95_bfrm_min</EM>,
with the corresponding daily data in <EM>95_bfrm_day</EM> (bfrm
refers to the instrument location at Bridge Farm).</P>

<P>The ASWS probes have not been calibrated at site, except for
the one occasion listed in the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/hyrex/data/Common/asws/CALIBRATION">asws/CALIBRATION</A>
file.</P>

<P>Very limited data quality information may be found in the <A
HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/hyrex/data/Common/aws/QUALITY">QUALITY</A> text file
in the AWS instrument directory, and in the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/hyrex/data/Common/asws/QUALITY/">QUALITY</A>
directory in the ASWS instrument directory.</P>

<H3>2.4 Disdrometer</H3>

<P>The disdrometer is located close to the AWS, but has been deployed
only during certain HYREX <A HREF="IOP.html">Intense Observing
Periods</A> (IOPs). It records the number and beam occupation
time of raindrops in 16 drop-size 'bins', with a sampling interval
of between 10 and 60 seconds.</P>

<P>Each data file in the disdrometer instrument directory <A 
HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/hyrex/data/Common/dis/">dis</A> contains one hour
of disdrometer data, where the hour is identified by the file
name (e.g. <EM>d95090805</EM>). The only quality note is that
sample time stamps (and file name times) during the summer months
are BST and not GMT.</P>

<H3><A NAME="RGS"></A>2.5 River gauging station</H3>

<P>The River Brue is gauged at the catchment outlet at Lovington
(UK Surface Water Archive no. 52010). River level is recorded
every 15 minutes and is converted to flow using a well-established
rating equation. Both levels and flows are held in the dataset,
and the record extends for nearly 8 years before the start of
HYREX.</P>

<P>The text file <A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/hyrex/data/Common/rgs/RATING_lov">RATING_lov</A>
in the river gauging station instrument directory <A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/hyrex/data/Common/rgs/">rgs</A>)
lists the rating equation coefficients. Each data file contains
one year of data, and has a name of the form <EM>95_lov</EM>.
The <A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/hyrex/data/Common/rgs/QUALITY">QUALITY</A>
text file contains a few notes on missing data.</P>

<H3><A NAME="Landuse"></A>2.6 Land use data</H3>

<P>LandSat data have been used to derive 5 classes of land use
(urban, grass, arable, forest, water) on a 50m pixel grid covering
the catchment. It is possible that other digitised geographic
data for the HYREX experimental catchment may be made available
at a later date.</P>

<P>The data are held in the file <A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/hyrex/data/Common/landuse/brueland.dat">landuse/brueland.dat</A>,
whose format is described in the text file <A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/hyrex/data/Common/landuse/brueland.txt">landuse/brueland.txt</A>.</P>

<H2>3. Transferring HYREX data from the BADC</H2>

<P>The common infrastructure dataset filenames, formats and directory
structures have been maintained in adding the data to the BADC
data directories. All of the datasets described here are supplied
in ASCII files. Most files are compressed with the standard UNIX
compress utility (adaptive Lempel-Ziv encoding) although some
are plain ASCII text. UNIX compressed (.Z suffix) files can be
uncompressed using the standard public domain program gzip.</P>

<H3><A NAME="Start"></A>3.1 Before you start</H3>

<P>You may need gzip installed on your local system to uncompress
some of the data files - the source code is available from software
archives. You will also need to know <A HREF="/help/howtogetdata_gzip_and_tar.html">how
to use gzip</A> once you have the files on your system.</P>

<H3><A NAME="Files"></A>3.2 Transferring and unpacking files</H3>

<P>With the exception of the UKMO-suplied radar datasets, all
files may be transferred either directly from these WWW pages,
or via FTP <a href="/help/ftp_guide.html">FTP</a>. FTP is probably
more efficient for downloading a large number of files. The UKMO
files may only be FTP'd from a named BADC account (see under Restricted
Data on the <A HREF="index.html">HYREX welcome page</A>).</P>


<P>All the data are in ASCII files compressed using the standard
UNIX compress utility. The documentation and software files are
uncompressed ASCII files, with the exception of <EM>download.xls.Z</EM>,
which is a compressed Microsoft Excel 6.0 file containing field
reports on raingauge data. Use UNIX uncompress, GNU gzip, or an
equivalent utility to unpack them.</P>

<H3>3.3 Finding data, documentation and software files</H3>

<P>HYREX common infrastructure data, documentation and software
files are located beneath the directory <A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/hyrex/">/badc/hyrex</A>.
Here you will find a README file and the following subdirectories</P>

<UL>
  <LI><A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/hyrex/data/Common/">data/Common</A>
  <LI><A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/hyrex/doc/common/">doc/Common</A>
  <LI><A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/hyrex/software/common/">software/common</A>
</UL>

<P>The data directory contains a subdirectory for each of the
instruments, along with several text files describing the organisation
and format of the data files. Each instrument directory contains
the appropriate data files (subdivided into monthly directories
for the two radars) and additional text files relating to data
quality.</P>

<P>The doc directory structure mirrors the data directory tree,
but it contains only documentation (text) files. Most of these
files are simply links to the corresponding files in the data
directory tree.</P>

<P>The software directory contains software for reading the data
files. The only such software is that used to read the radar data,
located in the <EM>software/readrad</EM> directory.</P>

<H3><A NAME="Using"></A>3.4 Using the data</H3>

<P>Read the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/hyrex/data/Common/NEWS">data/Common/NEWS</A> file for latest data news.
<P>Read the <A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/hyrex/data/Common/FORMATS">data/Common/FORMATS</A>
file for a detailed description of the data records and fields
in each type of data file.</P>

<P>The raingauge, catchment-average rainfall, AWS, ASWS, and river
gauging station data are in simple tabular formats and should
be straightforward to load into most spreadsheets or databases.</P>

<P>Simple programs may need to be written to handle the radar,
disdrometer and landuse data. A FORTRAN subroutine for reading
the radar data can be found in <EM>software/common/readrad</EM>.</P>
