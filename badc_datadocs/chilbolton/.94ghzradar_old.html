<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>This dataset consists of effective radar reflectivity factor
(<I>Z</I>) measured by the 94 GHz <I>Galileo</I> cloud radar situated
at Chilbolton, England (51.1445&deg;N, 1.4370&deg;W). The instrument
is a bistatic system that operates continuously round the clock
in a vertically-pointing configuration. It was developed for the
European Space Agency by Officine Galileo, the Rutherford Appleton
Laboratory and the University of Reading. The characteristics
of the radar are as follows:</P>

<H3>History of operations</H3>

<P>The radar was initially operated in summer 1996 for a few months,
but a problem with sensitivity was found. This was rectified when
the radar was Dopplerised, and from September 1999 until February
1999 the instrument was operated from the `Receive cabin' at Chilbolton.
It was then mounted on the side of the main 25 m antenna to permit
scanning with the 3 GHz radar, although did not operate round
the clock until the end of April 1999. In 17 October 2000 it was
removed from the side of the main dish to solve the problem of
gaps in the data whenever the 25 m antenna was scanning through
precipitation. The data described here are from 1 May 1999 until
17 October 2000. Doppler velocities measured during this time
were unreliable and so have not been included in the dataset.</P>

<H3>Processing that has been applied to the data</H3>

<P>The following stages of processing have been applied to the
raw data (in this order):</P>

<UL>
  <LI>True linear averaging of the original 1-s data to 30 s.
  <LI>Rejection of rays recorded when the radar was pointing more
  than 5&deg; from zenith (i.e. when the 3 GHz CAMRa radar on to
  which the 94 GHz radar was attached was scanning through precipitation).
  <LI>Rejection of `glitched' rays when the data acquisition system
  got out of sync with the transmitter.
  <LI>Calculation of the noise level by looking at the assumed
  cloud-free gates between 13 and 14.5 km. This is stored in the
  <TT>nez</TT> variable.
  <LI>Subtraction of the noise component from the measured echo
  power, and thresholding of the resulting signal.
  <LI>Clean-up of speckle noise by rejecting cloudy pixels or pairs
  of cloudy pixels with cloud-free pixels above and below them.
  <LI>Range correction of the data to account for the inverse square
  law and any range offset.
  <LI>Application of calibration figure (to both <TT>Zh</TT> and
  <TT>nez</TT>).
</UL>

<P>The result, valid for data taken between 1 May 1999 and 17
October 2000, is that the minimum-detectable signal is around
-52 dB<I>Z</I> at 1 km and -32 dB<I>Z</I> at 10 km. The `<TT>chil2nc</TT>'
program was used to process the data and convert it to NetCDF;

<H3>Interpretation of radar reflectivity factor and calibration
issues</H3>

<P>It is taken for granted that if quantitative use is to be made
of the <I>Z</I> values then the user has a fairly good understanding
of the concept of radar reflectivity and how it is related to
the particle size distribution. In this section therefore we concentrate
on calibration issues, although the problem of attenuation at
94 GHz is also discussed since it is much stronger than at lower
frequencies.</P>

<P>Our approach to calibration of the 94 GHz radar is by reference
to the 3 GHz `CAMRa' radar at Chilbolton. CAMRa can be calibrated
absolutely by exploiting the non-independence of the radar parameters
<I>Z</I>, <I>Z</I><SUB>DR</SUB> and <I>K</I><SUB>DP</SUB> in heavy
rain, as described by Goddard et al. (1994). However, to compare
the two radars directly requires a Rayleigh-scattering target
which is both near enough for attenuation to be small at 94 GHz,
yet far enough that near-field and ground-clutter effects are
small at 3 GHz. This is actually very difficult, but until early
1999 the 35 GHz <I>Rabelais</I> radar (on loan from the University
of Toulouse) was available to bridge the gap. Calibration was
performed both during and shortly after the CLARE'98 experiment
that took place at Chilbolton in October 1998. The <I>Rabelais</I>
was calibrated by comparison with CAMRa during scans through light
rain, and then <I>Galileo</I> was calibrated from <I>Rabelais</I>
by comparing vertical profiles through low liquid water cloud.
The result was that the <I>Galileo</I> noise-equivalent reflectivity
factor (<TT>nez</TT>) at 1 km was found to be -36&plusmn;1.5 dB<I>Z</I>.
This value should be independent of the data acquisition system,
the length of the cables etc., so we have used it as a benchmark
to calibrate the instrument in all recording modes, including
in this dataset. However, it does not account for any degredation
of the sensitivity in the two years following calibration.</P>

<P>It is important to understand the convention used in the intercalibration
of radars of different frequencies because of the temperature
dependence of the |<I>K</I>|<SUP>2</SUP> parameter of liquid water
at millimetre wavelengths. We have calibrated our radars such
that Rayleigh-scattering liquid water droplets at 0&deg;C produce
the same reflectivity factor at all frequencies. For example,
a population of 100&micro;m droplets with a concentration of 10<SUP>6</SUP>
m<SUP>-3</SUP> at 0&deg;C would have a <I>Z</I> of 0 dB<I>Z</I>
at all frequencies. Hence a radar at frequency <I>f</I> (after
calibration and correction for attenuation) will report an effective
reflectivity given by</P>

<P>where <I>M<SUB>f</I></SUB> is the Mie/Rayleigh backscatter
ratio. |<I>K<SUB>f,0</SUB></I>|<SUP>2</SUP> is the dielectric
parameter of liquid water at 0&deg;C, and is 0.93 at 3 GHz, 0.877
at 35 GHz and 0.668 at 94 GHz. Because the |<I>K<SUB>f</SUB></I>|<SUP>2</SUP>
of liquid water varies with temperature at 94 GHz, if the example
above were repeated at 20&deg;C, a 94 GHz radar using this calibration
convention would report a <I>Z</I> of +0.82 dB<I>Z</I> while a
3 GHz radar would still report 0 dB<I>Z</I>. Formulae for the
dielectric constants of ice and liquid water can be found in Liebe
et al. 1989.</P>

<P>Attenuation by both atmospheric gases and liquid water is much
stronger at 94 GHz than at lower frequencies. At 10&deg;C, 1013
mb and 100% humidity, the one-way attenuation due to gaseous attenuation
at 94 GHz is 0.636 dB km<SUP>-1</SUP>. In summer the typical two-way
gaseous attenuation to top-of-atmosphere is 2 dB. If the temperature
and humidity profile is know with some degree of accuracy (such
as from a model or a radiosonde ascent) then gaseous attenuation
can be corrected for. However, when low clouds are present then
the liquid water attenuation can easily exceed the gaseous attenuation,
and of course the profile of cloud liquid water content is generally
far more uncertain. This makes quantative use of the reflectivity
data in ice difficult if there is any low cloud present. At 10&deg;C
and 1013 mb, the one-way attenuation of 1 g m<SUP>-3</SUP> of
liquid water is 4.34 dB km<SUP>-1</SUP>. Attenuation by rainfall
is even greater, and in moderate and heavy rain can extinguish
the signal completely.</P>

<H3>Known problems with the data</H3>

<OL>
  <LI>Gaps in the data are present due to:
  <UL>
    <LI>The CAMRa radar (to which <I>Galileo</I> was attached from
    February 1999 to October 2000) scanning through precipitation.
    Cloud data were not recorded whenever the pointing angle was
    more than 5&deg; from zenith.
    <LI>Glitches in the data caused by the data acquisition system
    losing sync with the transmiter. These events were easy to detect
    and reject.
  </UL>
  <LI>A 50 kHz interference was present in the raw data which,
  if unchecked, results in anomalous horizontal `lines' of cloud
  every 3 km in processed time-height plots of reflectivity. This
  problem has been tackled in the following ways:
  <UL>
    <LI>Characterising the shape of the oscillation in the cloud-free
    gates at the top of each ray, and then using this knowledge when
    subtracting the noise from the remainder of the ray.
    <LI>Removing isolated cloudy pixels or pairs of pixels from the
    processed ray.
    <LI>Manual removal of any remaining erroneous echos.
  </UL>
  <P>Removing this interference has unavoidably compromised the
  sensitivity to some extent. Also, some anomalous echos may still
  be present in some of the data, although they are fairly easy
  to locate subjectively. The removal of pairs of pixels (indicated
  by the <TT>options</TT> attribute containing the string `<TT>-doubleclean</TT>')
  obviously will remove any genuine cloud that is only two range
  gates thick.
  <LI>The reflectivity values in the lowest gates are affected
  by:
  <UL>
    <LI>Ground clutter and leakage of the transmit pulse into the
    receiver: this appears as a fairly constant return (in time)
    in the lowest 6 to 8 gates that falls off rapidly with range.
    <LI>The near field effect: this appears as decrease in the <I>Z</I>
    of rain in the lowest 2 or 3 gates. The far-field approximation
    is generally applicable beyond 2&times;<I>antenna diameter</I><SUP>2</SUP>/<I>wavelength</I>,
    which for the <I>Galileo</I> radar is 225 m. A slight error in
    the range calibration could also have contributed to the apparent
    reduction of <I>Z</I> in the closest few gates.
    <LI>Insects: although the problem is much less at 94 GHz than
    35 GHz (due to the fact that insects are usually Mie scatterers),
    on some hot summer days insects are apparent between dawn and
    dusk as fairly low <I>Z</I> values up to 3 km. They can be distinguished
    from cloud using data from the Chilbolton lidar ceilometer. </OL><H3>Conditions
    of use</H3> If data from the <I>Galileo</I> radar is used in
