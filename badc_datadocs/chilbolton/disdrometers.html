<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Disdrometers
measure the drop size distribution of rain. Distromet Joss Waldvogel Impact Disdrometer RD-69 are installed at
Chilbolton and Sparsholt and work by converting the vertical momentum of a
falling drop into signals whose amplitude depends on the diameter of the impacting
drop. A
conical styrofoam body is used to transmit the mechanical impulse of an
impacting drop to a set of two moving coil systems in magnetic fields.</p>

<h3>Data format</h3>

<p>The data are in NetCDF format. There is a
file for both the Chilbolton Observatory and the supporting Sparsholt station 8
km to the SE.</p>

<h3>Conditions of use</h3>

<p>If data are used in any publication or
report then acknowledgement must be given to the Radiocommunications Research
Unit at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory for providing the data.</p>

<h3>Who to contact</h3>

<p>If you have problems obtaining the data,
please contact the <a href="http://www.ceda.ac.uk/contact/">British Atmospheric Data Centre.</a></p>
