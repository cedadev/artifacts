<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Microwave radio signals can be badly
affected when rain or sleet is present along the path between transmitter and
receiver. The signal is absorbed and scattered, becoming much weaker than
normal. This creates difficulties for telecommunications operators who need to
guarantee a reliable service in all weathers. As higher frequencies are used by
radio operators the characteristics of these outages have sometimes been
surprising a research is taking place to investigate the propagation losses at
these higher bands.</p>

<p>Monitoring is taking place of the signal
levels of several links at frequencies of 38, 54 and 56 Ghz which run from the
South Wonston water tower on the A34 to Sparsholt College. The links are within
coverage of the Chilbolton Advanced Meteorological Radar. </p>

<p>Data are logged every second 24 hours a day .</p>

<h3>Data format</h3>

<p>The data are NetCDF format.</p>

<h3>Conditions of use</h3>

<p>If data are used in any publication or
report then acknowledgement must be given to the Radiocommunications Research
Unit at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory for providing the data.</p>

<h3>Who to contact</h3>
