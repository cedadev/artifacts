</p>

<ul>
<li>Rotronic Temperature and Relative Humidity Sensor 
<li>KDG Pressure Transducer
<li>Vector Instruments A100H Anemometer
<li>Vector Instruments W200 Windvane
</ul>

<h3>Data format</h3>

<p>
The data are collected into a single file in NetCDF format. There is a file for both the Chilbolton Observatory and the supporting Sparsholt station 8 km to the SE. These measurements ended at Sparsholt on 22 May 2007.
