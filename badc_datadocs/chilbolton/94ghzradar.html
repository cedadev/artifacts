<H1>Chilbolton 94 GHz <I>Galileo</I> radar data</H1>

<H3>Introduction</H3>
<P>This dataset consists of effective radar reflectivity factor (<I>Z</I>) 
measured by the 94 GHz <I>Galileo</I> cloud radar situated at Chilbolton, 
England (51.1445°N, 1.4370°W). The instrument is a bistatic system that operates 
continuously round the clock in a vertically-pointing configuration. It was 
developed for the European Space Agency by Officine Galileo, the Rutherford 
Appleton Laboratory and the University of Reading. 
<P><B>This document is a revision of the original documentation of 26 February 
2001, and describes the recalibrated data that was released to BADC in spring 
2002. If you have used the reflectivity values of the original <I>Galileo</I> 
data for anything quantitative then you should definitely download the newer 
data, as there was a steady and significant loss of sensitivity during the 18 
month duration of this dataset, that we were previously unaware of.</B></P>

<P></P>
<H3>History of operations</H3>
<P>The radar was initially operated in summer 1996 for a few months, but a 
problem with sensitivity was found. This was rectified when the radar was 
Dopplerised, and from September 1999 until February 1999 the instrument was 
operated from the `Receive Cabin' at Chilbolton. It was then mounted on the side 
of the main 25 m antenna at Chilbolton to permit scanning with the 3-GHz radar, 
although did not operate round-the-clock until the end of April 1999. On 17 
October 2000 it was removed from the side of the main dish to solve the problem 
of gaps in the data whenever the 25 m antenna was scanning through 
precipitation. During this time the output power from the instrument dropped 
steadily; the calibration section below discusses the implications of this for 
sensitivity and calibration. Doppler velocities measured during this time were 
unreliable and so have not been included in the dataset. The data described here 
are from 1 May 1999 until 17 October 2000.</P>
<P>From January 2001 to March 2002 the radar was operated from the ground at 
Chilbolton and a new data acquisition system installed which permitted 
measurement of the mean Doppler velocity and Doppler spectral width. Operations 
from the ground meant that the data stream was not interrupted every time the 
3-GHz radar was scanning, but unfortunately it also meant that direct 
cross-calibration with the 3-GHz radar was not possible. Nonetheless, it is 
hoped that these data can be released on BADC in the future.</P>
<H3>Processing that has been applied to the data</H3>
<P>The following stages of processing have been applied to the raw data (in this 
order): 
<UL>
  <LI>True linear averaging of the original 1-s data to 30 s. 
  <LI>Rejection of rays recorded when the radar was pointing more than 5° from 
  zenith (i.e. when the 3-GHz CAMRa radar on to which the 94 GHz radar was 
  attached was scanning through precipitation). 
  <LI>Rejection of `glitched' rays when the data acquisition system got out of 
  sync with the transmitter. 
  <LI>Calculation of the noise level by looking at the assumed cloud-free gates 
  between 13 and 14.5 km. This is stored in the <TT>nez</TT> variable. 
  <LI>Subtraction of the noise component from the measured echo power, and 
  thresholding of the resulting signal. 
  <LI>Clean-up of speckle noise by rejecting cloudy pixels or pairs of cloudy 
  pixels with cloud-free pixels above and below them. 
  <LI>Range correction of the data to account for the inverse square law and any 
  range offset. 
  <LI>Application of calibration figure (to both <TT>Zh</TT> and <TT>nez</TT>). 
  <LI><I>Spring 2002:</I> Recalibration based on numerous calibration events 
  with the 3-GHz radar. </LI></UL>
<P></P>The result of this processing is that the minimum-detectable signal at a 
range of 1 km was around -50 dB<I>Z</I> in May 1999, increasing to around -38 
dB<I>Z</I> in October 2000. The sensitivity decreases with range according to 
the inverse square law; therefore the minimum-detectable signal at 10 km is 100 
times (20 dB) higher than at 1 km. The `<TT>chil2nc</TT>' program was used to 
process the data and convert it to NetCDF; source code for the latest version 
may be downloaded from <A 
href="http://www.met.rdg.ac.uk/radar/software.html">http://www.met.rdg.ac.uk/radar/software.html</A>. 

<H3>Data format</H3>
<P>The data is provided as daily <A 
href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/">NetCDF</A> files containing 
the following variables: 
<UL>
  <DL>
    <DT><TT>frequency</TT> 
    <DD>The frequency of the radar in GHz (94.00). 
    <DT><TT>latitude</TT> 
    <DD>The latitude of Chilbolton in degrees north (51.1445). 
    <DT><TT>longitude</TT> 
    <DD>The longitude of Chilbolton in degrees east (-1.4370). 
    <DT><TT>altitude</TT> 
    <DD>The altitude of the radar antenna above mean sea level in metres (90 m 
    when the radar was on the side of the main CAMRa dish). 
    <DT><TT>time</TT> 
    <DD>A vector containing the centred time of each ray of data, in decimal 
    hours UTC. 
    <DT><TT>range</TT> 
    <DD>A vector containing the centred range from the antenna, in km, of each 
    range gate. Note that to get height above mean sea level you should add the 
    <TT>altitude</TT> to this value. 
    <DT><TT>nez</TT> 
    <DD>A vector containing the `noise-equivalent radar reflectivity factor' at 
    1 km in dB<I>Z</I> (i.e. the level of the thermal and instrumental noise 
    normalised to a range of 1 km), after calibration. It is calculated for each 
    ray using the range-gates between 13 and 14.5 km which are assumed to be 
    cloud free. It increases through the dataset due to the steady loss of 
    instrument sensitivity, but can also vary on short timescales by as much as 
    2 dB when low clouds pass overhead because of the change in sky brightness 
    temperature at 94 GHz. 
    <DT><TT>Zh</TT> 
    <DD>An array containing effective radar reflectivity factor, in dB<I>Z</I>. 
    A value of -999 dB<I>Z</I> indicates that no signal was detected. The 
    <TT>comments</TT> attribute contains the following string: <I>Calibration 
    convention: in the absence of attenuation, a cloud at 273 K containing one 
    million 100-micron droplets per cubic metre will have a reflectivity of 0 
    dB<I>Z</I> at all frequencies. In addition to the usual sources of 
    attenuation at 94 GHz (liquid water clouds, water vapour, oxygen, melting 
    snow and rain), it has been found that when the radomes covering the 
    antennae of the radar become wet, they strongly attenuate the beam, 
    typically by more than 10 dB. Reflectivity values measured at all altitudes 
    during rain (and shortly afterwards) should therefore not be trusted.</I>

  <DL>
    <DT><TT>history</TT> 
    <DD>The record of programs that have operated on the data file since its

    <DD>This attribute contains the following message: <I>It has been found that 
    the transmitter of the Galileo radar has been losing power steadily since 
    around September 1999. Recalibration of the entire dataset from May 1999 to 
    October 2000 (the parameters Zh and nez) has been performed by comparing 
    with the 3 GHz radar at Chilbolton in 13 scanning events. The 3 GHz radar is 
    itself calibrated to better than 0.5 dB using the method of Goddard et al. 
    (1994, Electronics Letters 30, 166-167). The resulting Galileo calibration 
    is believed to be accurate to around 1.5 dB. It should be noted that this 
    loss of sensitivity means that the fraction of clouds not detected by the 
    radar will increase through the dataset.</I> </DD></DL></UL>

<P>Simple programs to read NetCDF files of Chilbolton data into Matlab, IDL and 
PV-WAVE can be found at <A

</P>
<H3>Interpretation of radar reflectivity factor and calibration issues</H3>
<P>It is taken for granted that if quantitative use is to be made of the 
<I>Z</I> values then the user has a fairly good understanding of the concept of 
radar reflectivity and how it is related to the particle size distribution. In 
this section therefore we concentrate on calibration issues, although the 
problem of attenuation at 94 GHz is also discussed since it is much stronger 
than at lower frequencies.</P>
<P>Our approach to calibration of the 94 GHz radar is by reference to the 3 GHz 
`CAMRa' radar at Chilbolton. CAMRa can be calibrated absolutely by exploiting 
the non-independence of the radar parameters <I>Z</I>, <I>Z</I><SUB>DR</SUB> and 
<I>K</I><SUB>DP</SUB> in heavy rain, as described by Goddard et al. (1994). 
However, to compare the two radars directly requires a Rayleigh-scattering 
target which is both near enough for attenuation to be small at 94 GHz, yet far 
enough that near-field and ground-clutter effects are small at 3 GHz. We correct 
for gaseous attenuation at 94 GHz using the temperature and humidity from either 
the ECMWF or Met Office models, and make the small correction for the near-field 
effect at 3 GHz using the expression of Sekelsky (2001). The results are 
expressed in the figure below in terms of the noise-equivalent reflectivity at 1 
km (see the definition of <TT>nez</TT> above): 
<CENTER><IMG 
src="calibration_curve_94ghz.jpg"></CENTER>The 
error bars indicate the 13 calibration events and their estimated uncertainty, 
and the numbers indicate the Chilbolton tape number. A steady deterioration in 
sensitivity is evident, which is due to a loss of transmit power from the tube. 
Given the uncertainties in the intercomparison of the two radars, the error in 
the resulting 94-GHz reflectivity factor after calibration is estimated to be 
around ±1.5 dB<I>Z</I>.
<P></P>
<P>It is important to understand the convention used in the intercalibration of 
radars of different frequencies because of the temperature dependence of the 
|<I>K</I>|<SUP>2</SUP> parameter of liquid water at millimetre wavelengths. We 
have calibrated our radars such that Rayleigh-scattering liquid water droplets 
at 0°C produce the same reflectivity factor at all frequencies. For example, a 
population of 100µm droplets with a concentration of 10<SUP>6</SUP> 
m<SUP>-3</SUP> at 0°C would have a <I>Z</I> of 0 dB<I>Z</I> at all frequencies. 
Hence a radar at frequency <I>f</I> (after calibration and correction for 
attenuation) will report an effective reflectivity given by 
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>Z<SUB>f</SUB></I> = <FONT color=blue>Integral from <I>D</I>=0 
  to <I>D</I>=infinity {</FONT> 
  (|<I>K<SUB>f</SUB></I>|<SUP>2</SUP>/|<I>K<SUB>f,0</SUB></I>|<SUP>2</SUP>)

  d<I>D</I> <FONT color=blue>}</FONT>,</BLOCKQUOTE>where <I>M<SUB>f</I></SUB> is 
the Mie/Rayleigh backscatter ratio. |<I>K<SUB>f,0</SUB></I>|<SUP>2</SUP> is the 
dielectric parameter of liquid water at 0°C, and is 0.93 at 3 GHz, 0.877 at 35 
GHz and 0.668 at 94 GHz. Because the |<I>K<SUB>f</SUB></I>|<SUP>2</SUP> of 
liquid water varies with temperature at 94 GHz, if the example above were 
repeated at 20°C, a 94 GHz radar using this calibration convention would report 
a <I>Z</I> of +0.82 dB<I>Z</I> while a 3 GHz radar would still report 0 
dB<I>Z</I>. Formulae for the dielectric constants of ice and liquid water can be 
found in Liebe et al. (1989).
<P></P>
<P>Attenuation by both atmospheric gases and liquid water is much stronger at 94 
GHz than at lower frequencies. At 10°C, 1013 mb and 100% humidity, the one-way 
attenuation due to gaseous attenuation at 94 GHz is 0.636 dB km<SUP>-1</SUP>. In 
summer the typical two-way gaseous attenuation to top-of-atmosphere is 2 dB. If 
the temperature and humidity profile is known with some degree of accuracy (such 
as from a model or a radiosonde ascent) then gaseous attenuation can be 
corrected for. However, when low clouds are present then the liquid water 
attenuation can easily exceed the gaseous attenuation, and of course the profile 
of cloud liquid water content is generally far more uncertain. This makes 
quantitative use of the reflectivity data in ice difficult if there is any low 
cloud present. At 10°C and 1013 mb, the one-way attenuation of 1 g 
m<SUP>-3</SUP> of liquid water is 4.34 dB km<SUP>-1</SUP>. Attenuation by 
rainfall is even greater, and in moderate and heavy rain can extinguish the 
signal completely. Wetting of the radomes of the radar also introduces a large 
attenuation; see point 4 in the next section.</P>
<H3>Known problems with the data</H3>
<OL>
  <LI>Gaps in the data are present due to: 
  <UL>
    <LI>The CAMRa radar (to which <I>Galileo</I> was attached from February 1999 
    to October 2000) scanning through precipitation. Cloud data were not 
    recorded whenever the pointing angle was more than 5° from zenith. 
    <LI>Glitches in the data caused by the data acquisition system losing sync 
    with the transmiter. These events were easy to detect and reject. </LI></UL>
  <LI>A 50 kHz interference was present in the raw data which, if unchecked, 
  resulted in anomalous horizontal `lines' of cloud every 3 km in processed 
  time-height plots of reflectivity. This problem has been tackled in the 
  following ways: 
  <UL>
    <LI>Characterising the shape of the oscillation in the cloud-free gates at 
    the top of each ray, and then using this knowledge when subtracting the 
    noise from the remainder of the ray. 
    <LI>Removing isolated cloudy pixels or pairs of pixels from the processed 
    ray. 
    <LI>Manual removal of any remaining erroneous echos. </LI></UL>Removing this 
  interference has unavoidably compromised the sensitivity to some extent. Also, 
  some anomalous echos may still be present in some of the data, although they 
  are fairly easy to locate subjectively. The removal of pairs of pixels 
  (indicated by the <TT>options</TT> attribute containing the string 
  `<TT>-doubleclean</TT>') obviously will remove any genuine cloud that is only 
  two range gates thick. 
  <LI>The reflectivity values in the lowest gates are affected by: 
  <UL>
    <LI>Ground clutter and leakage of the transmit pulse into the receiver: this 
    appears as a fairly constant return (in time) in the lowest 6 to 8 gates 
    that falls off rapidly with range. 
    <LI>The near field effect: this appears as decrease in the <I>Z</I> of rain 
    in the lowest 2 or 3 gates. The far-field approximation is generally 
    applicable beyond 2×<I>antenna diameter</I><SUP>2</SUP>/<I>wavelength</I>, 
    which for the <I>Galileo</I> radar is 225 m. A slight error in the range 
    calibration could also have contributed to the apparent reduction of 
    <I>Z</I> in the closest few gates. 
    <LI>Insects: although the problem is much less at 94 GHz than 35 GHz (due to 
    the fact that insects are usually Mie scatterers), on some hot summer days 
    insects are apparent between dawn and dusk as fairly low <I>Z</I> values up 
    to 3 km. They can be distinguished from cloud using data from the Chilbolton 
    lidar ceilometer. </LI></UL>
  <LI>Wetting of the radomes covering the two antennas of the radar has been 
  found to cause a two-way attenuation of 9-14 dB. The data should therefore not 
  be used quantitatively during rain events, which can be identified using the 
  Chilbolton rain-gauge data also provided by BADC. Other radars at 94 GHz 
  presumably also suffer from this problem.
