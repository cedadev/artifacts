<p>
Broadband visible/near infrared and far infrared radiometers (henceforth referred to as "visible" and "infrared") are operated at Chilbolton Facility for Atmospheric and Radio Research (CFARR).
</p>
<p>
The radiometers point vertically and collect downwelling flux by measuring the whole sky irradiance integrated over a range of wavelengths.  The visible band pyranometer measures solar irradiance over the wavelength range 305-2800nm; the infrared band pyrgeometer is blind to incident solar radiation but measures re-emitted longer wavelength radiation over the wavelength range 4.5-42&microm. 
Both instruments operate automatically and continuously.

<h3>Calibration down times</h3>

<p>
The instruments are sent for factory re-calibration every 2 years and were unavailable over the following periods:
</p>

<li>09/01/2004-19/02/2004 (pyranometer)
<li>09/01/2004-04/03/2004 (pyrgeometer)
<li>27/07/2006-08/09/2006 (both instruments)
 
<p>
In addition no data are available from either instrument during the period 05/10/2007 to 21/10/2007 inclusive.
