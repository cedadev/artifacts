<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>This dataset consists of attenuated backscatter coefficient
(beta) measured by the 905 nm <A HREF="http://www.vaisala.com/">Vaisala</A>
CT75K lidar ceilometer situated at Chilbolton, England (51.1445&deg;N,
1.4370&deg;W). The CT75K is a low power instrument designed
principally for accurately determining the height of cloud base.
However, the backscatter profile also contains potentially useful
information on the optical properties of clouds and aerosols.
Due to the low power and relatively long wavelength, the CT75K
is unable to detect molecular backscatter. It operates continuously
and has the following characteristics:</P>

<H3>History of operations</H3>

<P>The lidar has operated continuously at Chilbolton, with occasional
breaks for maintenance, since summer 1996. It was pointing directly
at zenith until 26 April 2000 when it was inclined 5 degrees off
vertical towards the west (in order to avoid specular reflection
from horizontally-aligned planar crystals), and has remained this
way ever since. We may well move it close to zenith in future
in order to better match with the radar, which is usually operated
at zenith so that the Doppler information is not affected by horizontal
winds.</P>

<P>The data acquisition PC uses NTP (network time protocol) to
ensure that the time stored in the data files is accurate. However,
a software upgrade on 10 August 2000 inadvertently deactivated
this feature, with the result that the time drifted somewhat until
1 September 2000, when the clock was found to be fast by 7 minutes.
The time was changed from 09:25:10 to 09:18:10 and the NTP process
restarted. It is reasonable to suppose that time was being gained
in a linear sense, equating to a gain of 19 seconds per day since
08:00 UTC on 10 August 2000.</P>

<H3>Processing that has been applied to the data</H3>

<P>The Vaisala data acquisition system performs the following
in real-time: range correction, noise subtraction, gain control
based on the transmit power, and calculation of the first three
cloud base heights from the attenuated backscatter profile. Data
are recorded as 30-s/30-m averages. The main problem with raw
data from this system is the background speckle noise, which is
highly variable in intensity (with individual values of beta sometimes
going negative), and of a nature that is difficult to understand
theoretically. Our approach in removing it is to first estimate
the standard deviation of the noise in each ray from the 8 highest
gates and store it in the <TT>stdn</TT> variable (this variable
can be used to see how bad the noise problem was and thus get
a qualitative sense of the sensitivity of the lidar in each ray).
The data are then cleaned up by ascending through each beta profile,
and essentially assigning a confidence level to each pixel based
on the magnitude of the signal relative to the standard deviation
of the noise, the vicinity of other cloudy pixels, the approximate
optical depth of the cloud up to that point, and the range to
the instrument (favouring low signals that are close-by). Pixels
with too low a confidence value are rejected. The results of this
algorithm can be seen by comparing the raw and clean quicklooks
which should have been provided with the NetCDF data files.</P>

<P>The `<TT>ceil2nc</TT>' program was used to process the data
and convert it to NetCDF; source code for the latest version may
be downloaded from <A HREF="http://www.met.rdg.ac.uk/radar/software.html">http://www.met.rdg.ac.uk/radar/software.html</A>.</P>

<P><A NAME="interpretation"></A></P>

<H3>Interpretation of attenuated backscatter coefficient and cloud
base height, and calibration issues</H3>

<P>It is assumed that the user has a fairly good understanding
of the concept of attenuated lidar backscatter coefficient, and
is aware of the difficulties involved in inverting it to obtain
optical depth. In this section therefore we discuss only calibration
issues and the quality of the cloud base height products.</P>

<P>The raw attenuated backscattering coefficient data produced by 
the ceilometer are nominally calibrated. However we apply another 
calibration which gives an improvement on this. The method involves 
integrating the backscatter coefficient up through a cloud that completely 
extinguishes the signal (see O'Connor et al. 2004). Theoretically this integral should
be equal to 1/(2<I>S</I>), where <I>S</I> is the extinction-to-backscatter
ratio. For liquid water clouds with mean droplet diameters in
the range 5-50&micro;m, <I>S</I> at 905 nm should be equal to
18.5 sr, so this approach provides a means of calibration. If
the effects of multiple scattering are neglected then we find
that the raw beta values are around a factor of 2.05 too low.
However, calculations suggest that multiple scattering acts to
increase the integrated backscatter by around 20%, with the result
that <B>the raw attenuated backscatter coefficients are
multiplied by 2.45 to calibrate them.</B> Due to the assumptions
made in the multiple scattering calculations, we estimate the
uncertainty in this figure to be around 20%. Users are warned
that no comparison with other lidars has been performed to cross
check this calibration figure.</P>

<P>The cloud base products are exactly the values produced by
the Vaisala data acquisition system. It calculates the height
of the first three cloud bases by performing a so-called Klett
inversion of the beta profile assuming a fixed extinction-to-backscatter
ratio, and considers the slope, absolute value and historic observations
at that height (the exact algorithm is regarded as commercially
sensitive by Vaisala so unfortunately has not been released by
them). The bases of liquid water clouds (at temperatures above
and below 0&deg;C) are characterised by high beta values above
a sharp gradient in beta, and they typically extinguish the lidar
signal very rapidly. Thus when liquid water cloud is present,
the algorithm has no difficulty in determining the height of its
base, but is unable to reliably detect the base of any clouds
that may be above it. In ice clouds on the other hand there tends
to be no sharp gradient in beta and the cloud base reported is
unreliable. We therefore recommend only using the first cloud
base reported by this instrument when the beta at that height
is high enough for it to be composed of liquid water.</P>
