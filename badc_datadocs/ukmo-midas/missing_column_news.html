Earlier this week it came to our attention that data files generated by the Data Extractor Service while extracting MIDAS data from the WX hourly weather data had a missing column in the header line. The cloud_type_id_3_q header, between cld_amt_id_3_q and cld_base_ht_id_3_q, was indeed missing. 
This was causing subsequent headers to be incorrectly associated to the data colums below, particularly affecting relative humidity readings and associated quality control flag (which values endede up in the snow amount column).
