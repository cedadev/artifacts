<H1><A NAME="intro"></A>1. Introduction</H1>

<P>Since the early days of this century the Met Office has been
responsible for maintaining the public memory of the weather.
All meteorological observations made in the UK and over neighbouring
sea areas have been carefully recorded and placed in an archive
where they may be accessed today by those with an interest in
the weather and where they will also be available to those in
future generations. Up to fairly recently all observations have
been recorded on paper forms which, when completed and checked,
have been stored in secure archive buildings. Today there are
archive sites at Bracknell, Edinburgh and Belfast. In this way
the Met Office has met the requirements of the Publics Record
Act for public access to the Met Office&#146;s technical records.

<P>In the age of computers, paper records are an unsuitable format
for meteorological data and in 1959 a new system was introduced
whereby all current climate data received at the Met Office was
manually keyed and stored in digital format. At the same time
a limited number of records for earlier years were also transferred
into digital format so that some continuous climate sequences
were available immediately. In the 40 years that have elapsed
since those days the digital climate record has been maintained
and, as more automation has occurred, especially within observing
systems themselves, the role of the paper record has declined.
Today fewer and fewer paper records arrive at the archives and
their principal purpose is a historical one.

<P>The storage of climate data at the Met Office has slowly developed
over time, first as a collection of data on paper or magnetic
tape, then, from the early 1970s as an organised database, the
CDB, which served many users until its final demise in July 1998.
The current climate database is MIDAS (Met Office Integrated
Data Archive System) which has a relational structure.

<P>The MIDAS database contains the following general types of
meteorological data:

<UL>
  <LI>Surface observations over land areas of the UK as far back
  as the digital record extends
  <LI>A selection of global surface observations for the last 20
  years
  <LI>Global surface marine observations from national and international
  sources as far back as the digital record extends
  <LI>Radiosonde observations over the UK, and at overseas stations
  operated by the Met Office, as far back as the digital record
  extends
  <LI>A selection of global radiosonde observations for the last
  10 years
</UL>

<P>MIDAS does not contain any remote sensing data such as radar
estimates of precipitation, thunderstorm locations or satellite
imagery. Such data are stored by the Met Office but they are
not part of this archive.

<P>The purpose of this guide is to describe the basic features
of the observing systems used over the years, the way the observations
have been processed and stored in the database and the general
characteristics of the data. It is aimed at those with little
familiarity with observing methods or instrumentation.

<H1><A NAME="2"></A>2. Methods of observing</H1>

<OL>
  <P><A NAME="2.1"></A><h2>2.1. The site</h2> <h3><I>Location</I></h3>
  <P>The location of the site should be selected in such a way
  that the observations are representative on a scale required
  from the station; a station in the synoptic network should make
  observations to meet synoptic scale requirements, a rainfall
  station should measure the impact of local orography on the rainfall
  amount, while an aviation station should observe the local conditions
  at the aerodrome. As far as it is possible, stations in the synoptic
  and climatological networks meet the following requirements for
  site location:
  <UL>
    <LI>The site should be representative of an area up to several
    tens of km from the station
    <LI>The instruments should be installed on level ground
    <LI>There should be no steeply sloping ground in the vicinity
    and the site should not be in a hollow
    <LI>The site should be well away from trees or any other large
    obstructions. The distance of any such object should be not less
    than twice the height of the object, and preferably four times
    the height
    <LI>The site should be adequately protected to exclude entry
    by unauthorised persons
    <LI>It must be possible to meet the exposure requirements of
    the raingauge, sunshine recorder and anemometer. Separate sites
    may be chosen for these instruments.
  </UL>
  <P>It is unavoidable that some sites do not meet all these requirements,
  particularly where a station set up for one purpose gradually
  takes on a different role, for example an airport site originally
  established for aviation observing may become a key synoptic
  or climate station while suffering the effects of urbanisation.
  A few sites are in city centres and may be unsuitably located
  close to large obstacles or even on the roof of a building.
  <P>The horizontal location of the station and its height above
  mean sea level are determined from the position of the principal
  raingauge.
  <P><h3><I>Layout of the instruments</I></h3>
  <P>Most instruments at the station are located close together
  in the enclosure, a flat area of ground approximately 10 m by
  7 m covered by short grass and surrounded by fencing. Typically
  the enclosure contains one or more raingauges, a screen containing
  the thermometers, soil thermometers, a concrete slab with a concrete
  minimum thermometer, a grass minimum thermometer, and a sunshine
  recorder. Where there is a 10 m anemometer mast it is often at
  a separate location. The barometer may be located in a building,
  often some distance from the enclosure, such as the forecast
  office if the station has a forecasting function.
  <P><A NAME="2.2"></A><h2>2.2. Manual observing practice</h2>
  <P>Until recent years all surface observing has been performed
  manually; the observer reads the instruments, makes visual estimates
  of visibility, cloud, present weather and the state of ground,
  records the observation on paper, and, if the station produces
  SYNOP and NCM messages, encodes the report and transmits it.
  An observation pad or pocket register is provided for noting
  the observation as it is made, a permanent record being made
  once the observation is complete. At synoptic stations observations
  are recorded in the daily register in permanent ink, which then
  becomes the official record for the station. Daily observations
  at climate stations are recorded on climate forms which are returned
  to the Met Office at the end of each month. Metform 3208b is
  in use at present but there have been a variety of different
  form types in the past. The observer may also have other climate
  returns to complete such as the analysis of hourly wind from
  anemograms, hourly sunshine from sunshine cards, and hourly rainfall
  from a rain recorder. A return of instrumentation in use at the
  station should also be completed once a year.
  <P>With the introduction of automated systems the role of the
  human observer has diminished. Even where a station remains manned
  24 hours a day the process of reading the instrument, processing
  the result, encoding the message, and transmitting the data is
  largely automated today by systems such as SAMOS. The observer
  is still required to make the an observation of those parameters
  for which automated systems of measurement either do not exist
  or are insufficiently accurate, for example, snow depth, state
  of ground, cloud and present weather. He also has the capability
  of modifying the automated input if it is considered to be in
  error. At such stations the Daily Register is discontinued and
  the only permanent record of the observation is the electronic
  one contained in the MIDAS database.
  <P><A NAME="2.3"></A><h2>2.3. Automatic observing systems</h2>
  <P>Automation, which began in the 1970s, now affects virtually
  all aspects of synoptic observing, and to a lesser extent the
  observations from the climate and rainfall networks. Automated
  systems have been developed as:
  <UL>
    <LI>A complete replacement of the human observer &#150; the station
    becomes fully automatic
    <LI>An aid to the human observer - the mechanistic parts of the
    observing process are automated
    <LI>A means of logging data from a particular instrument
  </UL>
  <P>An unavoidable consequence of automation has been the increased
  number of missing observations in the climate record. The human
  can improvise by using an alternative means if the primary system
  fails, the machine can not. The data loss at some fully automatic
  stations can be as high as 5%. A second consequence of automation
  has been the gradual replacement of one type of instrumentation
  by another; the Electrical Resistance Thermometer has replaced
  the liquid-in-glass thermometer, and the tipping bucket raingauge
  has replaced the 5 inch raingauge. This may have significant
  consequences for the user of the climate record interested in
  small departures from the long term average.
  <P><B><I>SAWS, ESAWS, SIESAWS and CDL</I></B>
  <P>The Synoptic Automatic Weather Station (SAWS) was the first
  fully automated observing system deployed in any number by the
  Met Office. The system operated at many remotes sites and provided
  hourly SYNOP messages from the mid 1980s. It was later replaced
  by the Enhanced SAWS (ESAWS) which is capable of producing hourly
  climate messages (HCM) and 12-hourly national climate messages
  (NCM) in addition to the SYNOP. A version designed to operate
  in severe icing environments, SIESAWS, has been installed at
  a few high level locations. Climate Data Loggers (CDL) of a number
  of different designs have been installed at a number of sites
  during the 1990s; most record the main synoptic and climate parameters
  and there is a facility for polling the data remotely. There
  is a project underway to develop their use as real time observing
  systems.
  <P><B><I>SAMOS and CODET</I></B>
  <P>The Met Office has developed SAMOS (Semi Automatic Meteorological
  Observing System) and CODETS (Coded Observation Data Entry Transmission
  System) to aid the manual production of observations. Both are
  PC based systems which can generate the full range of messages
  for a synoptic station (SYNOP, NCM, SREW, HCM), the CODET system
  being specially designed to operate at auxiliary stations. The
  observer can add to or modify any part of the observation through
  the PC. Quality control checks are incorporated into the interface.
  The SAMOS system can operate in automatic mode in the following
  ways:
  <UL>
    <LI>By default at any synoptic hour if no observer input has
    been provided by a specific time (at present set at HH-5min)
    <LI>For selected hours at stations which are only part manned,
    for example at weekends
    <LI>For all hours where the system has been installed at an unmanned
    station.
  </UL>
  <P><B><I>Rainfall and wind loggers</I></B>
  <P>A number of rainfall and wind logging systems have been installed
  at Met Office stations since the 1970s. The data are recorded
  on magnetic medium at the site and transferred at monthly intervals
  to MIDAS. The SSER and MTER loggers for rainfall are covered
  in section 5.5 and the DALE logger for wind is covered in section
  5.4. The Environment Agency operates a number of rainfall loggers,
  but only derived daily values from selected stations are stored
  in MIDAS.
  <P><A NAME="2.4"></A><h2>2.4. Observation time</h2>
  <P>The standard of time for all UK observations is GMT. This
  was not always the case in the early days of observing, but it
  is thought that any observations recorded by clock time have
  been entered against the correct hour GMT in the MIDAS database.
  The meteorological convention for midnight is 0000 hours on the
  new day.</p>
  <p>All non-UK Observation times are in UTC.<p>
  <P>WMO recommendations state that the observation should be made
  in as short a time as possible just prior to the nominal time
  of observation and that the pressure reading should be taken
  last at the exact hour. The UK practice since the 1960s, and
  possibly from an even earlier date, has differed from this recommendation
  in the case of real time observations for reasons connected with
  transmission schedules which are no longer valid. These observations
  are typically completed by HH-10 and transmitted before the hour
  is complete. This practice has continued to the present day,
  even where SAMOS and ESAWS automatic systems are installed, and
  applies not only to the SYNOP report, but also to the NCM, SREW
  and HCM messages. CDL systems, by contrast, record observations
  on the synoptic hour.
  <P><A NAME="2.5"></A><h2>2.5. Calibration, maintenance and inspection</h2>
  <P>Most measurements are made with full traceability to national
  or international standards; in other words, it can be demonstrated
  that a series of calibrations have been performed which link
  the instrument used for the measurement to some national or international
  standard instrument. This practice, which for temperature and
  pressure has been unbroken since 1851, ensures a uniformity of
  measurement over time. Instruments are calibrated after receipt
  from the manufacturer and in some cases at intervals after that
  (aneriod barometers and some wind, radiation and humidity sensors
  are returned for recalibration every few years, but not thermometers).
  Some of the other checks performed to ensure a properly functioning
  observing system are as follows:
  <OL>
    <LI>Observers perform basic routine checks of equipment quality
    as part of normal observing practice.
    <LI>Observations and the observing practice are checked. The
    oncoming shift checks the offgoing and a supervisor, if present,
    has a monitoring role.
    <LI>Observations are monitored routinely on receipt and technicians
    are called out where faults occur.
    <LI>Regular maintenance is performed on all instrumentation.
    <LI>Regular inspections of all surface land stations are carried
    out. Checks are made of equipment, exposure and observing practice.
    Check readings are taken.
    <LI>Quality control is performed on all data in the climate database
    MIDAS (see section 7).
  </OL>
  <P><A NAME="2.6"></A><h2>2.6. Sources of metadata</h2>
  <P>The term metadata, as applied to observations, is taken to
  mean those data which describe the contents of the climate archive
  and which allow the user to understand the origins of the meteorological
  values themselves. They describe the characteristics of the observational
  networks and typically include details about the station, its
  location, environment and observing programme as well as information
  about the instruments, their relative locations and exposure
  at present and at times in the past. Observational metadata for
  UK stations have been built up over the years from several sources:
  <UL>
    <LI>Records by those managing the station networks
    <LI>Records held at the stations themselves
    <LI>Inventories of instruments held returned annually to the
    Met Office (though this practice ceased in the 1990s)
    <LI>Reports from regular inspections of the station
    <LI>Records in the climate section of the Met Office responsible
    for collecting and storing the observations.
  </UL>
  <P>Only a small part of all the information is stored in digital
  format. A metadata database is under development which will ensure
  that all recent station metadata will be available electronically.
</ul></ul>
  <P></ul><A NAME="3"></A><h1>3. Stations and networks</h1>
  <P>Surface observations over the UK meet many different requirements
  in such areas as forecasting, civil aviation, defence, commerce,
  industry, agriculture and research. Stations are organised into
  networks which are designed to meet particular user requirements,
  the details of which are contained in a series of UKON (United
  Kingdom Observation Network) documents; UKON1 deals with the
  synoptic network, UKON2 with the climate network, UKON4 with
  the wind network, UKON5 with the rainfall network and UKON8 with
  the sunshine and radiation network. The organisation of the present
  day networks is described in the rest of section 3 below.
  <UL>
    <P><A NAME="3.1"></A><h2>3.1. Synoptic network</h2>
    <P>The synoptic network meets the requirements of forecasting,
    nowcasting, NWP and international exchange for real time observations
    taken at intervals between 1 and 3 hours. The observed elements
    include weather, cloud, temperature, humidity, wind, visibility,
    pressure etc. contained in the SYNOP message (see 4.1). Most
    synoptic stations also report hourly rain in the SREW message
    (see 4.2) as well as observations which meet more general climate
    requirements in the HCM and NCM messages (see 4.4 and 4.5). The
    current synoptic network has an average station spacing of less
    than 50 km; it is made up of the following sub-networks:
    <UL>
      <LI>Regional Basic Synoptic Network (RBSN). The RBSN consists
      of some 30 stations, fully manned by professional observers,
      which produce hourly observations. A high level of accuracy and
      reporting reliability is expected. 3-hourly observations from
      these stations are exchanged in real time internationally on
      the GTS.
      <LI>Basic Synoptic Network. This consists of some 85 stations,
      many automated or semi-automated, which provide the same hourly
      observations as from the RBSN. At semi-automatic stations visual
      input from an observer is available only at certain times of
      the day; typically weekday working hours.
      <LI>Supplementary Network. This network of some 110 stations
      has a more irregular spacing and reporting frequency than the
      Basic Synoptic Network and is designed to sample a wider range
      of environments (e.g. coastal, upland, urban) for specific specialised
      business needs. Some stations are automatic and some are manned
      by auxiliary observers whose work may be in some weather related
      sector (e.g. coastguards). The observing schedule at auxiliary
      stations may be irregular and receipt of observations at any
      hour is not guaranteed.
      <LI>Aviation Network. Some 130 stations of the Aviation Network,
      based at airfields, produce half hourly METAR observations (see
      4.3) for the requirements of short period aviation forecasting.
      There is considerable overlap with stations in the Basic Synoptic
      Network.
    </UL>
    <P><A NAME="3.2"></A><h2>3.2. Climate network</h2>
    <P>The purpose of the climate network is to enable the climate
    of the United Kingdom to be determined and monitored and thereby
    meeting the requirements for international exchange, commercial
    applications and research. The UKON2 document specifies how requirements
    for network density, site representativity, observing schedules
    and accuracy are met at the present time. The minimum observing
    requirement at a climate station is the daily measurement of
    maximum temperature, minimum temperature and rainfall amount
    though many stations make a wider range of observations such
    as those elements listed in sections 4.5 &#150; 4.8. The current
    climate network is made up of the following sub-networks:
    <UL>
      <LI>Principal Climatological Stations (PCS). These are manned
      or automatic stations at which hourly reading are taken. Their
      spacing over the UK is around the WMO recommended value of 30
      km. Most are part of the synoptic network and provide their observations
      in real time.
      <LI>Reference Climatological Stations (RCS). These stations are
      designated to meet the UK needs for climate monitoring. All have
      a long observational record spanning at least 30 years and their
      distribution aims to be representative of the major climatological
      areas unaffected by environmental changes such as urbanisation.
      Hourly observations are desirable from these stations and most,
      but not all, are included in the PCS network.
      <LI>Ordinary Climatological Stations. These are climatological
      stations at which observations, made at least once a day, include
      readings of maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation
      amount. The observation time is normally 0900 UTC. There are
      some 500 stations in the network run both by authorities with
      an interest in the weather (e.g. National Trust, Forestry Commission,
      educational and agricultural institutions and local authorities),
      and by private individuals. In recent years a small number of
      Climate Data Loggers (CDL) have been added to the network. Observational
      data are usually returned at the end of the month.
      <LI>WMO Climate Stations. All WMO members identify a number of
      climate stations from which monthly CLIMAT reports are generated
      each month for international exchange. The surface CLIMAT message
      (see section 4.9) contains monthly mean values of such elements
      as rainfall, sunshine, and temperature as well as long term climatological
      averages. 20 UK stations have been identified as WMO Reference
      Stations most of which belong to the RCS network.
      <LI>GCOS Climate Stations. A subset of the WMO Climate Stations
      provide a contribution to the Global Climate Observing System
      (GCOS) which is specifically aimed at meeting the needs of research
      and monitoring of climate change. At present 6 UK stations are
      part of the GCOS surface network.
      <LI>Health Resort Stations. These stations are part of the network
      of Ordinary Climatological Stations but report daily at 1700
      local clock time. Although originally set up last century to
      publicise the healthy benefits of coastal resorts, their main
      use today is for the daily weather summaries that appear in local
      and national press. These stations do not necessarily meet the
      standards expected of the stations of the other climate networks.
    </UL>
    <P><A NAME="3.3"></A><h2>3.3. Wind network</h2>
    <P>Observations of wind are required from the synoptic network
    to meet the real time needs of forecasting and NWP and have usually
    always been based on 10-minute averages. The climatological requirement
    for wind measurement is more varied and observations using a
    wider range of averaging periods have been made. Although some
    wind-only sites exist, observations of wind are usually collocated
    with observations of other meteorological elements. The current
    wind network is made up of the following sub-networks:
    <UL>
      <LI>Synoptic wind network. All stations in the synoptic network
      (3.1) report wind in the SYNOP message; most are measured 10-minute
      means but visual estimates are made at some auxiliary stations.
      Stations with recording devices report values over the last three
      minutes prior to the observation time if there has been a significant
      change during the last ten minutes.
      <LI>Climatological wind network. Mean hourly winds are also reported
      from many stations in the synoptic network, either in real time
      in the HCM message or, as was generally the practice in the past,
      from an manual analysis of the anemograph record performed at
      the end of the month and returned on Form 6910. Some stations
      in the climatological network report a run of wind for a 24-hour
      period which is converted to a mean wind speed on storage in
      MIDAS.
      <LI>DALE network. Between 1980 and 1984 a DALE wind logging equipment
      was installed at some 75 stations across the UK. 1-minute averages
      of wind are stored on magnetic tape and returned to Bracknell
      at the end of the month for processing. With the introduction
      of SAMOS, DALE sites are gradually being phased out.

    <P><A NAME="3.4"></A><h2>3.4. Rainfall network</h2>
    <P>Although many of the requirements for the measurement of precipitation
    amount may be met by the stations in the climate network, it
    is important for some applications to be able to resolve detail
    on smaller space scales. Point to point variability, and therefore
    the interpolation error between two neighbouring stations, is
    larger for rainfall than for most other climate elements. In
    terms of station numbers, the rainfall network is largest having
    some 5000 stations currently open across the UK. Radar rainfall
    sites are not included in this network and their data are not
    yet part of the MIDAS database. The current rainfall network
    is made up of the following sub-networks:.
    <UL>
      <LI>Stations providing sub-hourly data. Solid State Event Recorder
      (SSER) logging devices have been in operation at some 50-60 stations
      since about 1986 (see 4.8). Some Water Authorities operate loggers
      but sub hourly data from these devices are not stored in MIDAS.
      <LI>Stations providing hourly data. Most stations in the Basic
      Synoptic Network report hourly rainfall as a SREW message transmitted
      in real time. Many stations have a record of hourly rainfall
      observations stretching back to 1959 or, in some cases, earlier.
      A number of CDL stations are equipped to provide real time hourly
      amounts.
      <LI>Daily rainfall stations. Daily rainfall, measured at 0900
      UTC, is provided from all stations of the Climate network. These
      are augmented by almost 4000 stations where rainfall is the sole
      observation made. The vast majority of stations in England and
      Wales are managed by the Environment Agency, while many of those
      in Scotland and Northern Ireland are managed by other government
      bodies. Although daily reading are preferred from these sites,
      some may only report weekdays, weekly, monthly or at some infrequent
      intervals. Data are returned monthly.
    </UL>
    <P><A NAME="3.5"></A><h2>3.5. Sunshine and radiation network</h2>
    <P>Stations in this network provide measurements of solar and
    terrestrial electromagnetic radiation and the duration of bright
    sunshine.
    <P>The routine measurement of solar radiation was started in
    the UK at Kew Observatory in 1908. Daily measurements of the
    direct solar irradiance were taken at noon when conditions allowed
    and this practice was continued for the next 40 years. Regular
    measurements of global and diffuse irradiance began at Kew in
    1946, at Lerwick and Eskdalemuir in 1952, and at Aberporth, Cambridge
    and London in 1957. The network in UK was further enlarged by
    the addition of co-operating stations making solar radiation
    measurements for their own purposes and by 1975 the network consisted
    of 29 stations with at least 5 years continuous recording of
    global radiation. At the present time (1996) the network consists
    of 11 Met Office manned stations and 20 unmanned stations (ESAWS)
    plus 17 co-operating stations.
    <P>Stations at present measuring radiation and sunshine may be
    assigned to any of 5 sub networks designed to meet specific user
    requirements:
    <UL>
      <LI>Climatological Radiation Network. A network of stations that
      will allow the climatology of radiation in the UK to be maintained.
      <LI>Climatological Sunshine Network. A network of stations that
      is required to maintain the climatology of sunshine in the UK.
      <LI>Synoptic Radiation Network. A network of stations that is
      required to provide solar and terrestrial radiation in support
      of numerical weather prediction and associated products.
      <LI>Synoptic Sunshine Network. A network of stations that is
      required to provide sunshine data in support of media enquiries
      and products.
      <LI>Reference Radiation Network. A network of stations that is
      required to provide high quality reference solar and terrestrial
      radiation measurements in support of research and development.
    </UL>
    <P><A NAME="3.6"></A><h2>3.6. Station identification</h2>
    <P>A station may be defined as a collection of instruments and
    observing systems, existing today or for periods of time in the
    past, which together may be considered as a common source of
    observations associated with a given location. At a typical station
    the thermometers and rain gauges are located in an enclosure,
    which is a small area of level ground suitably exposed to the
    weather. Not all instruments at a station are necessarily collocated;
    for example, the anemometer mast may be at the end of a runway
    some distance from the enclosure, the pressure sensor may be
    in a separate building and the estimate of visibility made be
    made on a roof-top. Observations from all these sources may,
    nevertheless, be regarded as representative of a single location
    represented by the station. The concept of a station is reinforced
    by the way meteorological observations are grouped together into
    reports: the SYNOP, NCM, SREW or F3208 reports (see section 4)
    represent groupings of observations from a common general location.
    Each report requires an identifying number or character string
    which links it to the originating station. Several identifying
    systems that have evolved over the years are described in more
    detail in the following sub-sections.
    <P>Over time certain instruments, or the whole enclosure, may
    be relocated some distance away from the original site. Where
    the distance moved is small, the observations obtained from the
    new site may have exactly the same climatological characteristics
    as previously and it makes sense to regard them as coming from
    the same source or station distinguished by certain identifiers.
    Where the distance moved is large, or, where the exposure at
    the new site is sufficiently different that a detectable impact
    on the measured climatology is judged likely, it is appropriate
    that observations from the new site are labelled by a different
    set of identifiers.
    <P><B><I>Station name</I></B>
    <P>The purpose of the station name is to give an unambiguous
    label to the source of observations such that no two stations
    have the same name. It should be meaningful, at least to those
    who know the locality.
    <P>The format of the station name is as follows:<BR>
    : : : <I>Principal Name [,Qualifying Name]</I><BR>
    where the square brackets indicate an optional field.
    <P>The Principal Name relates to the general location of the
    station; it may take the name of the nearest village, town or
    city, or, the name of the (small) island on which the station
    is located. When naming a station, Met Office staff have always
    tried to use a name which appears on an OS map. To avoid many
    stations having the same Principal Name, the names of large cities
    are often avoided.
    <P>A Qualifying Name, separated from the Principal Name by a
    comma, may often be required to ensure that each station name
    is unique; it is however optional. It is generally the name of
    some local feature such as a building, road or small geographical
    feature; e.g. <I>Walsingham, Hill House</I> and <I>Blackshiels,
    Fala Dam</I>. Where an observing site moves a small distance,
    but sufficiently far that that the new site is regarded as a
    new station, there might be no reason for wishing to change the
    station name. In such cases differing stations are identified
    by No.1, No2, &#133; etc. added on to the end of the Qualifying
    name; e.g<I>. Coldwell Resr, No.2</I>. <A NAME="wmo"></A>
    <P><B><I>WMO number</I></B>
    <P>Synoptic stations selected as suitable for possible international
    exchange are give a 5-figure WMO number which is used as the
    identifier for all SYNOP and SREW reports. It is also used as
    identifier for climate reports, NCM and HCM, exchanged within
    the UK in real time. The first 2 figures of the WMO number are
    03 which is the block number for the UK and Ireland. Numbering
    runs from north to south across Britain followed by Ireland.
    <A NAME="dcnn"></A>
    <P><B><I>DCNN</I></B>
    <P>All stations that are part of the climate network have a 4-figure
    DCNN (district county number). In general, if a station moves
    more than 800m in a region of homogeneous terrain it is allocated
    a new DCNN, while a lesser distance will justify a new DCNN only
    if it is considered that the exposure at the new site is sufficiently
    different to affect the measured climatology.
    <P><B><I>ICAO identifier</I></B>
    <P>Stations that are part of the aviation network have a 4-character
    international ICAO number. The first two character are EG which
    represent Europe-UK. <A NAME="rain"></A>
    <P><B><I>Rainfall number</I></B>
    <P>The principal purpose of the rainfall number is to identify
    a rainfall observing site. Where rainfall is the sole observation
    made at the station, the number doubles up as the station identifier.
    Where there is more than one rainfall observing site at the station,
    each site has a different rainfall number. Where the rainfall
    observing site moves, even a small distance, the new site is
    given a new rainfall number while the station may retain its
    original name, WMO number and DCNN; it is therefore very common
    for a station to be associated with several rainfall numbers,
    some identifying rainfall sites open today and some that existed
    in the past. It is also possible for more than one gauge to be
    attached to one rainfall number, for instance, 2 gauges may have
    existed in the enclosure, one used for the hourly reading and
    one for the 12-hourly reading.
    <P>Over the years, the observation branches of the Met Office
    have followed an agreed set of rules to determine whether measurements
    of rainfall should be considered as originating from a new source
    or rainfall number when the conditions under which rainfall observations
    are made changes. These are specified as the occurrence of one
    or more of the following:
    <UL>
      <LI>The new site is 400m (400yds) from the previous site
      <LI>The new site is 15m (50ft) altitude different from the previous
      site
      <LI>The new environment is different (degree of shelter)
      <LI>The new site is in a different stream catchment
      <LI>The type of rainfall collecting equipment changes
    </UL>
    <P>The last criterion is included because the rainfall number
    acts as an instrument and logging system identifier as well as
    a station identifier. This can lead to a number of confusing
    situations, for example, it is often the case that when a SAMOS
    system has been installed at a SSER site; the SSER retains its
    original rainfall number while the SREW and NCM reports from
    the same TBR are identified by using a different number (see
    section 5.5). Rainfall numbers run from north to south and uniquely
    identify the river basin and tributary nearest which the site
    lies. <A NAME="wind"></A>
    <P><B><I>Wind number</I></B>
    <P>Like rainfall number the wind number identifies the characteristics
    of the observing site. Each anemometer mast has a 6-figure wind
    number of the format DCNNnn, where nn=01,02,&#133; is the anemometer
    site number. A new site number is allocated to the observations
    if the mast is repositioned but not if the height of the anemometer
    on the mast is changed. A station may therefore be associated
    with several wind numbers.
    <P><B><I>Source identifier</I></B>
    <P>Within the MIDAS database, stations are uniquely determined
    by a source identifier which is an integer running from 1 upwards.
    All observations in the database are stored with their source
    identifier.
    <P><B><I>Station definition</I></B>
    <P>It can be seen that under the present organisation of the
    UK observing networks there is no unambiguous definition of a
    station. At any one time there is a network of synoptic stations
    identified by WMO numbers, a network of climate stations identified
    by DCNN and rainfall stations identified by rainfall number.
    However, the longer the historical record, the more complex the
    picture becomes and the less easy it is to define what collection
    of observations should be regarded as originating from a single
    station. The following rules define the stations stored in MIDAS
    labelled by their unique source identifier:
    <OL>
      <LI>A station is a collection of instruments and observing systems,
      existing today or for periods of time in the past, which together
      may be considered as a common source of observations associated
      with a given location.
      <LI>Each station may be considered as being made up of a number
      of clusters of instruments or observing systems, each defined
      by its location relative to the station position. Any 2 clusters
      will be regarded as belonging to the same station if:<BR>
      (a) at the present time or at some time in time in the past observations
      from both clusters have been reported under the same identifier
      (WMO/DCNN/ICAO/Rainfall/Wind), or,<BR>
      (b) one cluster may be considered as taking over the role of
      the other cluster on its closure.
      <LI>Each of the identifiers WMO/DCNN/ICAO/Rainfall/Wind will
      be associated with one and only one station. Where this rule
      has been broken in the past in the case of WMO numbers, a letter
      is added as a suffix. Each station may, however, have more than
      one WMO, DCNN, Rainfall or Wind number.
      <LI>Each source in MIDAS, identified by the attribute src_id,
      will be associated with a station as defined above and there
      will be a one-to-one correspondence with stations in the Metadata
      Database.
      <LI>Each station in MIDAS will be uniquely defined by its name
      and there is a one-one correspondence between src_id and station
      name. Information on other names used in the past will be stored
      in the metadata database.
      <LI>The station position is the current position of the primary
      rain gauge (assuming that there is one).

    6-hourly or irregular intervals. The hour of the observation
    is contained in the message header, rather than in the message
    itself, and there is no facility to specify the time of the observation
    to the nearest minute. As noted in Section 2 above, the UK practice
    for many years has regarded the actual observation time as HH-10.

    <P>Where the station observes at a time different from 0900 (0700,
    0800 or 1000) read that time in the table above in place of 0900.
    Where a daily observation or a sequence of daily observations
    are missing, for example because the observer is unavailable
    or the station is not manned 7 days a week, the rainfall accumulation
    for the first day after the break will represent a multi-day
    total; similarly the maximum and minimum values may represent
    extremes over several days. The correct interpretation of the
    readings will be made clear on the form and stored in MIDAS,
    where appropriate, with a day count greater than 1.
    <P>On the Met Form each line represents the observation for the
    given day; values of rainfall, maximum temperature, run of wind
    and sunshine are &quot;thrown back&quot; to the previous day,
    in the sense that, for example, the 24 hour accumulation of rainfall
    read at 0900 on the 10th is entered on the 9th because it is
    assumed that most of the rain fell on that day. This practice
    does not affect the way the data are stored in MIDAS as the database
    indicates the observation period by the two parameters: observation
    end time and hour count.
    <P>There were a great many different form types that preceded
    the 3208b, each allowing for the different observing practices
    that were in force at the time. MIDAS only contains the complete
    set of observed parameters since 1959; before that date only
    the main climate parameters (e.g. maximum, minimum and rainfall)
    are stored for selected stations and periods.
    <P>Stations of the rainfall network, for which rainfall accumulation
    is the only observation produce, return daily amounts on rain
    cards (Met Forms 7133, 7135). Where observations are made less
    frequently than once a day, multi-day accumulations are marked
    on the card and stored in MIDAS with a day count greater than
    1. Many stations in England and Wales are operated by the Environment
    Agency who may also return keyed data on tape to the Met Office.

      (see Section 5.5).
      <LI>Digital Anemograph Logging Equipment (DALE). A logging device
      that records 1-minute averages of wind speed and direction plus
      the maximum gust speed and direction of the maximum gust.
      <LI>Climate Data Loggers (CDL). Commercial and Met Office designs
      of CDLs create hourly and daily weather messages which may be
      retrieved by remote polling or downloading at the station onto
      floppy disk. The Met Office data format CAWS is used widely.
      <LI>Magnetic Tape Event Recorder (MTER). A precursor to SSER
      in use from about 1978-82 for recording tip times from tipping

    </TABLE><A NAME="4.10"></A><h2>4.10. Other message types</h2>
    <P>Check NCM
    <P>At manned or part-manned stations where an automated system
    such as SAMOS has been installed, Check NCM messages are normally
    transmitted in real time at 0900 each day. The message contains
    observations of air maximum, air minimum, grass minimum and concrete
    minimum from liquid-in-glass thermometers, and 24-hour rainfall
    accumulation from a 5 inch gauge. These observations, made with
    instruments used from climate observing for over 100 years, allow
    long-term comparisons to be made with the modern instrumentation,
    such as ERT and tipping bucket gauges, which are required for
    automation. A paper record of the Check NCM messages is kept
    at each station and returned at the end of the month since 1997.
    <P><B><I>Caretaker</I></B>
    <P>Routine maintenance at fully automated sites is undertaken
    by caretakers, perhaps once or twice a week, who in addition
    to cutting the grass and checking and cleaning the instrumentation,
    make check readings of air maximum, air minimum, dry bulb and
    wet bulb minimum from liquid-in-glass thermometers, and rainfall
    accumulation from a 5 inch gauge. Readings are recorded on paper
    and returned at the end of each month.
    <P><B><I>Water equivalent of snow</I></B>
    <P>Designated stations, mostly manned Met Office stations, make
    daily measurements of the water equivalent of any snow that is
    lying. 3 samples are normally taken at different locations around
    the enclosure from which the mean is calculated. All measurements
    are recorded on paper and returned at the end of the month between
    November and April.
  </UL>
  <P><A NAME="5"></A><h1>5. Characteristics of the data</h1>
  <UL>
    <P><A NAME="5.1"></A><h2>5.1. General</h2>
    <P>There is a convention, followed by the human observer, that
    where a value is read as half way between two points on the observing
    scale it is &quot;rounded to the odd&quot;, except for pressure
    which is rounded down. A value falling half way between 13.4
    and 13.5 would be reported as 13.5.
    <P><A NAME="5.2"></A><h2>5.2. Temperature</h2>
    <P><B><I>Units, accuracy and precision</I></B>
    <P>Temperature was recorded in degrees Fahrenheit before 1961
    and in degrees Celsius after that date. The precision of the
    measurement in the meteorological report has varied over the
    years:
    <UL>
      <LI>0.1C for all temperatures that are reported today
      <LI>1C for hourly temperatures received in SYNOP code prior to
      1982
      <LI>1F for many maximum and minimum temperatures prior to 1961
      <LI>0.1F for most air temperatures prior to 1961 and for some
      maximum and minimum temperatures prior to the 1920s
      <LI>0.5F for maximum and minimum temperatures at a few stations
      prior to 1961
    </UL>
    <P>All temperatures in MIDAS have been converted to Celsius and
    are stored with a precision of 0.1C. The J-descriptor indicates
    the original units of observation.
    <P>Instruments are calibrated on receipt from the manufacturer
    and at intervals after deployment by the QA Lab at Bracknell
    with the aim of ensuring that the accuracy of the measurement
    is better than 0.2C. Traceability to national standards has been
    maintained since 1858 and corrections determined from the calibration
    are applied to most observations made with the instrument. For
    the large majority of observations, MIDAS contains only the corrected
    value, however, at some climate stations in the past the normal
    practice was to record the original measurement on the meteorological
    form and only to apply the correction to the monthly mean. Reference
    to the original records stored in the archives is necessary to
    determine the observing practice at any particular station.
    <P><B><I>Liquid-in-glass thermometers</I></B>
    <P>A liquid-in-glass thermometer, having a surrounding glass
    sheath, has been the normal means of measuring temperature since
    the earliest days of observing. The liquid is generally mercury,
    except for minimum thermometers in which ethanol is used. Maximum
    and minimum thermometers are reset after the reading has been
    taken, by a vigorous shake in the case of the maximum, and by
    tilting upright in the case of minimum.
    <P><B><I>Electrical resistance thermometers</I></B>
    <P>Electrical thermometry is now in widespread use; its main
    virtue lies in the ability to automate the measurement process.
    Electrical resistance thermometers (ERT) first came into regular
    use in the early 1980s at the fully automatic SAWS stations,
    and since then have been introduced at all Met Office synoptic
    stations. The instrument measures the resistance of platinum
    which depends on temperature according to a quadratic relationship.
    As is the case for liquid-in-glass thermometers, calibration
    is performed at regular intervals by the QA Lab. There is no
    means of determining from the data stored within MIDAS whether
    an ERT or a liquid-in-glass thermometer was used to make the
    measurement, though this information may be found in the archived
    station documentation.
    <P><B><I>Screen level temperature</I></B>
    <P>The standard exposure for thermometers for measuring the dry,
    wet-bulb, maximum and minimum temperatures is at 1.25m above
    the ground in a louvered white screen of wooden construction.
    This design allows a free circulation of air around the thermometers
    while shielding them from precipitation and external radiation.
    <P><B><I>Grass and concrete minimum</I></B>
    <P>The grass minimum temperature is the lowest temperature reached
    overnight by a thermometer freely exposed to the sky with its
    bulb just touching the tips of short grass (25 to 50 mm above
    the ground). Normally the thermometer is exposed at the last
    hour before sunset and the reading is taken next morning. However,
    at stations where an observer is not available near sunset, such
    as at Ordinary Climatological Stations, the thermometer is often
    exposed throughout the day. When snow covers the ground the thermometer
    should be supported immediately above the surface of the snow
    without actually touching it, though this is only possible at
    manned stations. Doubtful readings, such as might occur where
    snow falls overnight, are not normally reported. Long grass and
    other characteristics of a poorly maintained site will cause
    inaccurate measurements.
    <P>The concrete minimum thermometer is exposed at the centre
    of, and in contact with, a concrete slab which should be cleared
    of any snow. At some climate stations in the first half of this
    century readings were taken over bare soil but these values have
    never been stored in MIDAS.
    <P><B><I>Soil temperature</I></B>
    <P>At many stations temperatures below the surface are measured
    at various depths. The depths used today are 5, 10, 20, 30 and
    100cm, although measurements are not necessarily made at all
    these depths at a station and exceptionally measurements may
    be made at other depths. When imperial units were in general
    use, typically before 1961, the normal depths of measurement
    were 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48 inches.
    <P>Liquid-in-glass soil thermometers at a depth of 20 cm or less
    are unsheathed and have a bend in the stem between the bulb and
    the lowest graduation. At greater depths the thermometer is suspended
    in a steel tube and has its bulb encased in wax.
    <P><B><I>Sources of error</I></B>
    <P>Common errors in the measurement of temperature include:
    <UL>
      <LI>Gross errors of manual reading: typically 1, 5, 10 degrees,
      reporting the wrong sign, or reading the wrong end of the minimum
      index (7 degrees)
      <LI>Breaking of the liquid column
      <LI>Parallax
      <LI>Maximum or minimum thermometers not properly reset the previous
      day
    </UL>
    <P>There may be slow changes in the characteristics of the thermometer,
    but these are reduced to a minimum by regular maintenance and
    calibration.
    <P><A NAME="5.3"></A><h2>5.3. Pressure</h2>
    <P>To be completed.
    <P><A NAME="5.4"></A><h2>5.4. Humidity</h2>
    <P><I>Units, accuracy and precision</I>
    <P>In MIDAS humidity is stored either as wet bulb temperature
    or as dew point to a precision of 0.1C. WMO accuracy requirements
    for wet bulb temperature are <U>+</U>0.2C or an equivalent <U>+</U>3-5%
    in derived values of humidity. Measurements of dry and wet bulb
    temperatures are reported to the nearest 0.1K and when units
    of measurement were Fahrenheit reports were given to the nearest
    0.1F.
    <P><B><I>Wet bulb thermometer</I></B>
    <P>Almost all observations of surface humidity have been made
    using a wet bulb thermometer though some recent automatic stations
    have a relative humidity sensor fitted. The wet bulb is exposed
    alongside the dry bulb in the meteorological screen with no additional
    ventilation other than that provided by the natural flow of air.
    The wet bulb is kept moist through the capillary action of water
    up a muslin wick. Where ERT thermometers are used, such as in
    any automatic station, the siting of instruments is the same.
    On occasions when air temperatures fall below zero, the wet bulb
    should be covered by a thin film of ice, this being ensured by
    the observer at manned sites each time a reading is taken. Conversion
    to a dew point uses values of saturated vapour pressure with
    respect to a ice covered surface.

    <P><B><I>Sources of error</I></B>
    <P>Common sources of error in the measurement of humidity include:
    <UL>
      <LI>Errors in the readings of the dry and wet bulbs or out of
      date corrections to the temperatures read.
      <LI>Contamination of the wick, especially where it has not been
      changed sufficiently frequently or impure water has been used.
      <LI>Drying out of the wick. This is a common problem at automatic
      stations in summer which are infrequently maintained by a caretaker.
      <LI>Poor ventilation on a calm day.
      <LI>Drops of water on the dry bulb in conditions of high humidity
      causing it to act as a wet bulb.
      <LI>Inappropriate ice covering of the wet bulb in freezing conditions,
      especially at automatic stations.
    </UL>
    <P><A NAME="5.5"></A><h2>5.5. Wind</h2>
    <P><I>Units, accuracy and precision</I>
    <P>Horizontal wind is a 2-dimensional vector and is usually reported
    as an averaged direction from which the wind is blowing and a
    speed. The maximum observed speed over a specified time interval
    and the time of occurrence may also be reported. The unit of
    speed used at UK stations is the knot (0.515&nbsp;ms<SUP>-1</SUP>)
    and the unit of direction the degree. Where observations of wind
    speed from overseas stations are in ms<SUP>-1</SUP>, values are
    converted to knots before storage. The data are reported to the
    nearest knot and 10 degrees in the SYNOP and HCM messages and
    on Form 6910. 1-minute DALE data are recorded to the nearest
    0.1 knot and 1 degree.
    <P>The accuracy requirements, which are met in most instances
    by the current synoptic network, are for speed to be measured
    within 1 knot or 10%, direction within 5 degrees and gust speeds
    within 10%. There are, however, larger errors in near calm conditions
    where the Munro anemometer is used (see below).
    <P><B><I>Averaging</I></B>
    <P>Speed and direction are averaged separately which introduces
    a slight overestimate of the mean vector. The calculation of
    mean direction has to take into account the cyclical nature of
    the measurement between 0 and 360 degrees. Where the sampling
    rate is sufficiently high, the maximum gusts are normally calculated
    from 3-second averages of speed and this is the case at most
    SAMOS stations today. A 1.5-second averaging period was used
    in early versions of SAMOS, it is still used at all ESAWS stations
    and it is the typical averaging period obtained from an anemograph
    trace. Metadata describing what averaging periods have been used
    at stations at a given date has been poorly recorded over the
    years. Where wind speed and direction are recorded on an anemograph,
    mean values and gust speeds are estimated by human analysis.
    Estimates of average speed from a continuously changing dial,
    which are subject to large error, are made at a few stations
    in the supplementary network. This observing practice was more
    common in the past.
    <P>10-minute averaged winds reported in the SYNOP message are
    for the period HH-20 to HH-10. Hourly mean winds in the HCM message
    and gusts reported in the SYNOP message are for the period HH-70
    to HH-10. Some Ordinary Climatological Stations report run of
    wind from an anemometer on a 2 m mast. This is converted to a
    24-hour mean wind speed in knots for storage in MIDAS.
    <P><B><I>Munro anemometer</I></B>
    <P>The Munro cup anemometer and vane have been the basic instrumental
    method for measuring wind in the UK for many years. Traditionally
    it has been connected to an anemograph and/or dial, but with
    the advent of automatic systems it has been attached various
    processing devices, e.g. the DALE logger. The cup has a large
    inertia and therefore has a relatively slow response time, but
    of more concern is the high start-up speed, which in the case
    of the Mk4 is about 6 knots. In 1998 a project began for the
    replacement of Munros by a lightweight anemometer with better
    response characteristics.
    <P><B><I>Other wind measuring methods</I></B>
    <P>Visual estimates of wind have been made a number of stations
    in the supplementary network for many years and the observations
    have been reported as 10-minute winds in the SYNOP message.
    <P>Dines pressure tube anemometers, having a better response
    at low wind speeds than the Munro, were installed at a number
    of stations in the early years of observing, but few of these
    instruments have remained in use in recent years.
    <P>SIESAWS systems use an orthogonal arrangement of pressure
    tubes to measure wind and have not proved reliable in the extreme
    environment in which they are sited. Light winds were not handled
    well but most now have a bias reset which the error.
    <P>Other methods of wind measurements, such as hot-wire anemometers,
    are not used in operational observing.
    <P><B><I>Exposure, effective height and corrections</I></B>
    <P>Correct exposure of the wind instrument is essential for accurate
    measurement. The standard exposure is over level, open terrain
    at a height of 10m above the ground. Open terrain is defined
    as an area where the distance between the anemometer and any
    obstruction is at least 10 times the height of that obstruction.
    Measurement of wind in the direct wake of buildings or a row
    of trees are of little value and this should be borne in mind
    with city centre or other highly sheltered sites. If standard
    exposure is unobtainable the anemometer may be installed at a
    height greater than 10m. Whether or not such an adjustment is
    made, all anemometers are allocated an &quot;effective height&quot;
    which is defined as the height above open, level terrain in the
    vicinity at which mean wind speeds would be the same as those
    actually recorded by the anemometer. Various methods have been
    devised for the calculation of effective height. At stations
    where the effective height differs substantially from the actual
    height, corrections are applied to the 10-minute wind speed reported
    in the SYNOP message. No corrections are applied to any gusts
    measurements or to any hourly mean wind speeds.
    <P><B><I>Wind analysis and processing methods</I></B>
    <P>Over the years many stations have provided climatological
    returns on Form 6910 containing hourly mean wind, speed/direction
    of the maximum gust in the hour and time of the maximum gust.
    The following rules have been applied for the analysis of the
    anemograph record:
    <UL>
      <LI>Time is determined from the daily time marks made by the
      observer. The observing period is defined as HH-60 to HH-0.
      <LI>Mean wind speeds are estimated to the nearest knot but a
      value of 1 knot is not normally reported. Where the mean speed
      is 0 or 1 knot and the wind vane shows gusty, but not smooth
      variations, the speed is reported as 2 knots and the gust as
      missing. A mean speed of 0 is only reported if the speed trace
      indicates calm over the complete 1 hour period and the vane is
      unmoving or records only smooth variations.
      <LI>Maximum gust speeds in each hour are analysed unless 2 knots
      is reported as above. The direction of the maximum gust during
      the 24 hour period is reported, but not the direction of the
      maximum gust in each hour.
    </UL>
    <P>1-minute speeds and directions from the DALE logging system
    are processed to provide mean hourly winds for the period HH-60
    to HH-0. For a number of years after its installation the processing
    method attempted to mimic the Form 6910 analysis method, in particular,
    no instances of 1 knot mean speed were allowed. This practice
    was discontinued in the mid 1990s after which date simple hourly
    averages of the 1-minutes data were calculated.
    <P><B><I>Sources of error</I></B>
    <P>Common sources of error in the measurement of wind include:
    <UL>
      <LI>Poor exposure at the site. Exposure may change gradually
      with time, for example as nearby trees grow, leading to slowly
      changing systematic errors in the climate record.
      <LI>Poor response in low wind speeds, particularly the Mk2 and
      Mk4 Munro anemometers which require a speed of 6 knots to start
      cup rotation.
      <LI>A scale error in measurements from DALE systems which resulted
      in mean and gust speeds 5% too low. This was corrected in the
      early 1990s (date unknown) in all stations except ESAWS. At ESAWS
      stations the error in the gust speed is almost cancelled by the
      effect of using an averaging time of 1.5 seconds rather than
      3 seconds.
      <LI>Calibration errors. Depending on the calibration methods
      used, systematic errors may be present in the speeds from anemographs
      and consequently in the speeds reported in Metform 6910. The
      most likely magnitude of the error is +5%.
      <LI>Stuck wind vane.
      <LI>Inaccurate estimation in the case of visual observations
      of wind.
    </UL>
    <P><A NAME="5.6"></A><h2>5.6. Precipitation</h2>
    <P><I>Units, accuracy and precision</I>
    <P>The total amount of precipitation which reaches the ground
    over a stated period is expressed as the depth to which it would
    cover a horizontal surface. The reported accumulation of rainfall
    is the sum of the amount of liquid precipitation plus the liquid
    equivalent of any solid precipitation (that is the liquid obtained
    by melting snow or ice that has fallen). Similarly, the depth
    of snowfall is expressed by the depth of fresh snow covering
    an even horizontal surface. The unit of rainfall is the mm and
    amounts are measured and reported to the nearest 0.2 mm, and
    where possible, to the nearest 0.1 mm. Snowfall is measured and
    reported to the nearest cm. Trace is reported where precipitation
    is observed during the period, but the amount would otherwise
    be reported as zero.
    <P>The inch was the unit of rainfall in the past and amounts
    were usually measured and reported to the nearest 0.01 in, but
    other levels of precision have been in use at a few stations
    (e.g. 0.005 in, 0.1 in). Inches were the sole unit of measurement
    in the 19th century and mm the sole unit since 1970, but in the
    long period between these dates the reporting practice varied
    from station to station. All rainfall accumulations in MIDAS
    have been converted to mm and are stored with a precision of
    0.1 mm. The J-descriptor indicates the original units of observation.
    <P>The achievable accuracy of precipitation measurements with
    raingauges in current use is about 5% though errors will be larger
    at exposed sites.
    <P><B><I>Ordinary raingauge</I></B>
    <P>An ordinary funnel-type raingauge has been in use for all
    manual measurements since the earliest days of observing. The
    design has varied over the years but today the Met Office strongly
    encourages conformity in order to maximise comparability of readings
    across the network. The standard design has a rim of diameter
    5 in (127 mm) standing 12 in (30 cm) above the ground. Raingauges
    based on the standard design are adapted to meet specific needs;
    there is a version having a capacity to hold a large volume of
    rain which is used in remote sites where readings may only be
    taken once a month. Exposure of the gauge should be on open ground
    distant from the effects of sheltering objects. At a few windy
    sites, established a number of years ago, there may be a surrounding
    turf wall of diameter 3&nbsp;m and height 30 cm which shields
    the gauge from the extreme effects of strong winds. Systematic
    differences as large as 12% have been noted between an unsheltered
    gauge and one within a turf wall. It is not the present practice
    to build turf walls at new stations.
    <P><B><I>Tipping bucket raingauge</I></B>
    <P>The tipping bucket raingauge is particularly suitable for
    the automation of rainfall measurement but it does not perform
    well in freezing conditions. It is based on a small container
    or bucket which, when filled with rain, tips and empties while
    recording the event electronically. The size of bucket used widely
    across the UK network holds 0.2 mm of rain. A larger 0.5 mm bucket
    is in use at some Environment Agency stations though only those
    at some remote or high level locations send readings to the Met
    Office. Bucket tip times may be stored directly by a data logger
    (such as the Met Office SSER system in use since the early 1980s)
    or converted locally to a rainfall accumulation by systems such
    as SAMOS, ESAWS or CDL.
    <P><B><I>Tilting siphon raingauge</I></B>
    <P>The tilting siphon raingauge produces an autographic record
    of rainfall accumulation from a pen attached to a float in the
    rainfall chamber of the instrument. The rainfall chart is analysed
    to give hourly accumulation as well as duration of precipitation
    where this exceeds 0.1mm/hour.
    <P><B><I>Sub-hourly accumulations</I></B>
    <P>The only sub-hourly data stored in MIDAS originate from Met
    Office SSER systems. The values are the tip times to the nearest
    minute from a 0.2 mm tipping bucket raingauge and span the period
    1982 to the present. Sub hourly data from Environment Agency
    loggers are archived locally by the Agency.
    <P><B><I>Hourly accumulations</I></B>
    <P>The earliest hourly accumulations of rainfall stored in MIDAS
    date back to 1949, but it was not until the 1960s that the network
    of stations reporting hourly began to increase. Some autographic
    rainfall records from before the war exist in the archives but
    these have never been digitised.
    <P>Hourly rainfall from a station may be observed and reported
    in one or more of 4 different ways, and the observation may be
    made using one of several raingauges at the site:
    <UL>
      <LI>A reading from a 5 inch gauge reported in the SREW for the
      period HH-70 to HH-10
      <LI>A reading from a tipping bucket gauge reported in the SREW
      (e.g. SAMOS or ESAWS station) for the period HH-70 to HH-10
      <LI>Manual analysis of the autographic record from a TSR reported
      on a 7113 form for the period HH-60 to HH-0
      <LI>Processing of the tip times recorded on a SSER or CDL logger
      for the period HH-60 to HH-0
    </UL>
    <P>A number of different practices for observing and storage
    of the climate data have become established over time depending
    on the equipment available at the station and the reports received:
    <UL>
      <LI>A station with one or more 5 inch gauges and no other rainfall
      instrumentation will use one of the gauges to record hourly rainfall
      which is reported in the SREW. A 12-hour total will be reported
      in the NCM, in most cases from a second gauge.
      <LI>A station with a TSR and one or more 5 inch gauges follows
      the practice above for the SREW and NCM but also returns hourly
      values on a Metform 7113 at the end of the month from an analysis
      of the autographic record from the TSR. To ensure consistency
      with the daily total measured using the 5 inch gauge (and reported
      in the NCMs), the analysed hourly values are adjusted to ensure
      that their sum equals that daily total. In other words, the 24
      hour total from the 5 inch gauge, which is regarded as the climatological
      standard, has been &quot;time sliced&quot; by the TSR. In MIDAS
      hourly values of precipitation amount from the 7113 form overwrite
      the SREW reports received earlier and precipitation duration
      is added.
      <LI>A fully automatic station uses the TBR for the SREW and NCM.
      <LI>A station with a SSER system connected to a TBR uses that
      gauge for the SREW. The analysis of TSR records on a 7113 form
      is discontinued and the 5 inch gauge remains the source of data
      for the NCM (except in the case of TBR failure when the TSR analysis
      is used to infill). Hourly totals are derived from SSER tip times
      are stored in MIDAS, overwriting the SREW; up to 1997 an adjustment
      was performed, similar to that for the 7113 analysis, which ensured
      that the 24 hour sum equalled the total from the 5 inch gauge.
      <LI>A station with a SAMOS system installed uses the TBR for
      the SREW and, in most cases, for the NCM. The analysis of TSR
      records on a 7113 form is often discontinued. Where a SSER system
      is also at the station the derivation of hourly values is performed,
      as described above.
    </UL>
    <P><B><I>12-hourly accumulations</I></B>
    <P>12-hourly accumulations of rainfall are contained in the NCM
    which is sent in real time twice a day at 0900 and 2100 from
    most synoptic stations. NCMs have been in use since 1982 before
    which time daily climate readings were returned each month on
    3259 forms. The NCM value is used for all climatological studies
    of rainfall on time scales of a day or more, and in the past
    the observation derived from the reference 5 inch gauge at the
    site. With the introduction of automated systems, as noted above,
    the tipping bucket gauge has become the reference gauge. This
    also applies to fully manned stations where a SAMOS system has
    been installed to simplify the manual observing process. All
    automated sites retain a 5 inch gauge, but it takes the role
    of a check gauge, which is used by the observer or the caretaker
    for additional readings, taken once a day, or perhaps less frequently,
    for checking purposes.
    <P><B><I>Daily accumulations</I></B>
    <P>Daily accumulations are the starting point for climatological
    studies of rainfall. They will originate from:
    <UL>
      <LI>The sum of the two 12-hour accumulations contained in the
      NCM sent from synoptic stations
      <LI>Daily observations at climate stations using the 5 inch gauge
      <LI>Daily observations at rainfall stations using the 5 inch
      gauge
      <LI>Processing of data from loggers (e.g. SSER, CDL) to give
      24-hour accumulations.
    </UL>
    <P>In addition, where an automated system is in operation, check
    readings are made by the observer, or if the station is fully
    automatic by the caretaker, using the 5 inch gauge. The values
    are not stored in MIDAS.
    <P>From the earliest days of observing in the UK, the standard
    period for measuring daily rainfall has been 0900-0900. However,
    at any time a few stations have departed from this practice;
    for example, some climate stations open today take the observation
    at 1000 and others, particularly in the first half of the 20th
    century, made observations at clock time.
    <P><B><I>Multiple-day accumulations</I></B>
    <P>The current dense network of rainfall stations relies heavily
    on contributions from observers whose profession is not meteorology;
    they may work voluntarily or for an employer in a weather related
    field. There is no guarantee that observations will be taken
    every day and indeed an infrequent observing schedule may be
    agreed when a station opens. It is also possible that the observing
    time of 0900 is not rigorously adhered to, particularly at remotes
    sites or where several gauges are read by one observer. Many
    observed rainfall totals are valid for periods of more than one
    day; a reading may be taken at 0900 on Monday covering 3 days
    over the weekend, or at remote sites, it might cover a complete
    month. In each case, readings for multiple-day accumulations
    of rainfall should be taken at 0900. All original values are
    stored in MIDAS with the day count set to the appropriate value.
    <P><B><I>Snowfall</I></B>
    <P>Depth of fresh snow and depth of lying snow are reported daily
    at 0900 at synoptic and climate stations and hourly at synoptic
    stations when snow is lying. Such measurements should exclude
    the effects of drifting or blowing snow. All reports of rainfall
    accumulation should include the liquid equivalent of any solid
    precipitation that has fallen in the period. At only a very few
    sites is the raingauge heated to improvement the measurement
    in snow. The effects of snow are a major source of error in the
    measurement of rainfall, see below.
    <P><B><I>Sources of error</I></B>
    <P>Common errors in the measurement of rainfall accumulations
    include:
    <UL>
      <LI>Gross errors in the reading or the transcription of values
      at manual stations
      <LI>Errors in the time the observation was taken. This is a particular
      problem at voluntary stations where the observer may have other
      duties. No record may be given for the actual time of observation.
      <LI>Small, but significant under recording by TSRs and TBRs in
      moderate to heavy rain during the period of siphoning or tipping.
      <LI>The effects of snow blocking the raingauge. This problem
      is particularly severe at automatic stations and may lead to
      the recording of spurious rainfall amounts as the snow melts.
      At manned stations any snow is cleared from TBR gauges at 09
      and 21, and a reading from the 5 inch gauge is used
      <LI>Malfunctioning instrument. A TBR may &quot;double bounce&quot;,
      that is produce a spurious rainfall tip event just after a genuine
      one. Insects and animals may be a problem at unmanned sites.
      <LI>Poor exposure of the gauge. Trees may have overgrown, or
      the site may be excessively exposed in strong winds.
      <LI>Damage due to vandalism or other causes at non-manned sites.
      <LI>Loss of a significant amount of rainfall in very heavy rainfall
      with light winds from a TBR. The shallow funnel angle causes
      water to splash out on the other side of the gauge.

    <P>To be completed.</P>
    <P><B><I>Sources of error</I></B>
    <ul>
    <li>   Where a manual shade ring is employed on the diffuse sensor,
    this might suffer from incorrect setting, particularly when there has been a lack of sunshine for several days, therefore producing little or no shadow to guide the Observer.
    <li>  Moisture in the sensor, when the silica gel is due for change.
    <li> Dirt, snow, or frost on the dome of the sensor.
    <li>Poor exposure is a major source of error.  Few instruments have

    <P><A NAME="5.8"></A><h2>5.8. Sunshine</h2>
    <P><I>The Campbell-Stokes recorder</I>
    <P>The routine measurement of sunshine was started in London,
    in 1853 by J.F.Campbell. His instrument was modified in 1880
    by Stokes into the ubiquitous Campbell-Stokes recorder which
    is still the official sunshine recording method in UK. The instrument
    has a mounted glass sphere which focuses the suns rays onto a
    thick card, burning a hole when the sun is shining. The passage
    of the sun across the sky translates into a linear burn pattern
    along the card which may be analysed by the observer to give
    measurements of sunshine duration. Most stations report hourly
    or daily (00-24) amounts of sunshine although health resort stations
    are an exception, reporting for the period 1700-1700.
    <P><B><I>Sources of error</I></B>
    <UL>
      <LI>Poor exposure is a major source of error. Few instruments
      have an unblocked view of the horizon across the span of azimuth
      required.
      <LI>Poor maintenance allowing dirt or ice to collect on the glass.
      The frame may not be levelled correctly.
      <LI>The instrument over records on days of broken cloud. Systematic
      errors may be as large as 20%. A short burst of bright sunshine
      can give a burn representing at least 0.1 hour while several
      of these in quick succession will appear as a continuous burn.
      Instructions for the analysis of a sunshine card state that start
      and end parts of the burn should be discounted, even so the analysis
      of a card on days of varying sun and cloud is open to many interpretations.
      <LI>Vandalism may often be a problem at partly manned stations.
      A glass sphere is a particularly attractive object.
    </UL>
    <P><A NAME="5.9"></A><h2>5.9. Visibility</h2>
    <P><I>Units, accuracy and precision</I>
    <P>Visibility is reported in m or km and is stored in MIDAS in
    dam. In the SYNOP message a non-linear code is used giving a
    reporting precision of 30m (30m to 100 m); 100m (100 m to 5 km);
    1km (5 km to 30 km) and 5&nbsp;km (30 km to 70 km). There is
    a further coarser reporting code for use where there are few
    visual reference points which is principally used at sea. The
    accuracy requirement for observations of visibility from the
    synoptic network is <U>+</U>10%. Where visibility is measured
    at climatological stations the accuracy achieved is generally
    less that this value.
    <P><B><I>Visibility estimated by the observer</I></B>
    <P>Visibility is defined as the greatest distance at which an
    object in daylight can be seen and recognised, or at night could
    be seen and recognised if the illumination was raised to daylight
    levels. Observations should be made at ground level not from
    observation towers or roof tops. The long standing method of
    observation has been estimation by the observer using known fixed
    reference points, such as trees or buildings, which stand out
    well against the background. Each reference point should subtend
    an angle of at least 0.5<SUP>o</SUP> at the eye. Estimation of
    visibility at night is prone to greatest error and should, ideally,
    by performed with the aid of suitable fixed lights. Visibility
    estimates on airfields, where accuracy is of particular importance,
    are often aided in this way. On occasions when the visibility
    varies in different directions, the minimum value should be reported
    in the main part of the message and this is the value stored
    in MIDAS. The guidance to observers at coastal stations states
    that only visibility over land should be reported; any differing
    values over the sea being noted in the remarks column of the
    weather register though it is not clear how closely this practice
    is followed at voluntary stations.
    <P>Vertical visibility may be reported from airfields in the
    SYNOP and METAR messages to a precision of 100ft. It is measured
    when the sky is obscured and the horizontal visibility tends
    to be very low. It is a visual measurement for which a nearby
    object of known height (and intermediate points of known or estimable
    height) may still be visible. In daylight the timed ascent of
    a pilot balloon rising vertically, at known rate, may also be
    used. It is an optional measurement, not being reported where
    reference objects are absent.
    <P>Runway visual range may be reported from airfields in the
    METAR message. It is defined as the maximum distance in the direction
    of take-off or landing at which the runway, or specified lights
    or markers along the runway, can be seen from a point above its
    centre line. The height of this point is taken to be 5m above
    ground level, corresponding to the average eye-level of pilots
    at touchdown. The observation is usually made by personnel belonging
    to the airfield authorities such as the Fire Service. Where there
    are two runways, for instance as at Heathrow, two measurements
    may be reported.
    <P><B><I>Visiometer</I></B>
    <P>Hand-held Gold visibility meters have been available for many
    years to aid the estimation of visibility, but it was not until
    the 1990s that visiometers have been widely installed at stations
    in the synoptic network for the automation of the measurement.
    Visiometers measure the transmissivity of a sample volume of
    air, expressed as the Meteorological Optical Range (MOR), which
    is converted for observational use into a visibility and coded
    directly into the SYNOP message at automatic stations. Where
    the station is manned the visiometer measurement may be altered
    by the observer if, in his judgement, it is in error or unrepresentative
    of the conditions obtaining at the time.
    <P><A NAME="5.10"></A><h2>5.10. Present and past weather</h2>
    <P>Present and past weather are only reported from a manned station,
    though present weather sensors are under development.
    <P>A weather group is reported only when there is or has been
    significant present or past weather during the period covered
    by the observation (present weather ww &gt; 03 or past weather
    W1 &gt; 2 or past weather W2 &gt; 2). Where there is no significant
    weather to report, the group is omitted and there is a null or
    missing data indicator in the hourly report in MIDAS.
    <P>At stations where manual input is available at all hours of
    the day special practices apply to the first observation taken
    after a break. The reported present weather should be taken as
    best assessment by the observer bearing in mind that he/she may
    not have been at the station for the whole of the previous hour.
    Similarly the first of the past weather values will be made in
    the same way. Where it is not possible to give a second past
    weather value a null value (/) will be reported.
    <P><A NAME="5.11"></A><h2>5.11. Clouds</h2>
    <P><I>Units, accuracy and precision</I>
    <P>Cloud height is one of the remaining meteorological parameter
    still measured in the imperial units. It is reported in code
    form for each of the cloud groups in the SYNOP message to a precision
    of 100ft (100ft to 5000ft), 1000ft (5000ft to 30000ft) and 5000ft
    (above 30000ft). Heights are converted to decametres (dam) for
    storage in MIDAS. Cloud amount has been measured in eighths since
    1949. Cloud amounts before 1949 were measured in tenths but have
    been converted to eighths for storage in MIDAS. The J-descriptor
    for the observation indicates the observation units and the sign
    of the rounding error where a conversion has taken place. In
    this way the original value as observed may be recovered.
    <P><B><I>Manual observations of cloud</I></B>
    <P>A complete observation of cloud containing amount, type and
    height of cloud base is available only from manned stations.
    The first automatic weather stations were not equipped to provide
    any cloud information, however, more recently some SAMOS stations
    operating automatically provide measurements of cloud height
    from a Laser Cloud Base Recorder (LCBR).
    <P>Manual observation of cloud height may be purely visual or
    be made with the assistance of measuring devices. Pilot balloons,
    with a lantern attached at night, may be timed to the point of
    entry into the cloud, and reports from aircraft are a valuable
    additional source of information at airfields. At some stations,
    especially airfield sites, cloud searchlights were used at night.
    These throw a spot of light on the base of the cloud at a height
    which can be measured by triangulation. Various cloud base recorders
    for measuring the height of cloud directly above the instrument
    have been used at times in the past. The Mark 3a (nodding beam,
    and the main one in use) and 3b (vertical beam) could measure
    heights up to 4000ft but the accuracy above 1000ft was not good.
    More recently, these have been replaced by LCBRs (see below).
    <P>In the report however there is no way of knowing whether the
    observer measured or visually estimated the cloud height - this
    information is noted only in the hand written daily register.
    <P>(NB Aircraft reports of cloud base and tops are reported in
    a separate message format but they are not stored in MIDAS.)
    <P><B><I>Laser Cloud Base Recorder (LCBR)</I></B>
    <P>Where Laser Cloud Base Recorders have since been installed,
    measurements are available of cloud amount and height at different
    layers up to a maximum of 25000 ft. Cloud amounts are obtained
    by processing data over time and are of limited accuracy; orographically
    forced cloud, not advected over the instrument, will not be recorded.
    At the manned stations the LCBR is used as an observing aid,
    while at automatic stations amounts and heights with missing
    cloud types are reported in the SYNOP message and stored in MIDAS.
    The ix indicator shows that the observation was made automatically
    and is also stored in MIDAS.
  </UL>
  <P><A NAME="6"></A><h1>6. Storage of data in MIDAS</h1>
  <P>MIDAS is a relational database residing on the Met Office&#146;s
  General Purpose Computer Server (GPCS) at Bracknell. The description
  of the structure of MIDAS, the relationships between the tables
  and the attributes of each table may be found in the MIDAS Handbook.
  This section gives details of how the observations described
  in the sections above are stored in the database and should be
  read in conjunction with the Handbook.
  <UL>
    <P><A NAME="6.1"></A><h2>6.1. Loading of data into MIDAS</h2>
    <P>MIDAS is not a real time database but every attempt is made
    to store data as soon after the time of receipt as is practically
    possible. Synoptic messages (SYNOP, METAR and SREW) and climate
    messages (NCM and HCM) arriving in real time at Bracknell are
    stored in the real time synoptic database, the MetDB. Programs
    run twice daily to load these data into MIDAS:
    <P>0400: SYNOP, METAR, SREW, NCM and HCM for 0000 &#150; 2300
    the previous day plus any late messages or correction to messages
    for earlier dates
    <P>1000: SYNOP and SREW for 0000 &#150; 0900 plus NCM for 0900
    <P>Monthly climate data that derive from forms, disks or tapes
    are loaded as soon as possible after they have been processed.
    This may be long after the observation time because of delay
    by the observing station in making the return. Data may not be
    received from some rainfall stations until 6 months or more have
    elapsed. Automatic quality control is applied to real time data
    once a day after the 0400 loading has completed, similar quality
    control is applied to climate data as soon as possible after
    loading. Detail of the manual and automatic quality control procedures
    are given in section 7.
    <P>The synoptic reporting system allows for the transmission
    of a correction message (COR) by a station if some part of the
    original message is seen to be in error. Where a COR message
    is received and the original has already been loaded into MIDAS,
    the corrected value overwrites the original on the next occasion
    that data loading takes place and any quality control flags are
    unset. Where observations are so much in error that it is not
    possible to store them in MIDAS, the data are sent to a rejects
    file where they are investigated by quality control staff at
    a later date.
    <P><A NAME="6.2"></A><h2>6.2. Attributes for each observation
    record</h2>
    <P>Each observation record has attributes which identify the
    station, observation period, observed value, quality flags and
    instrumentation information. The following describes the attributes
    in use.
    <P><B><I>Station identifier</I></B>
    <P>The station source for each observation record is defined
    by the unique source identifier (SRC_ID) and ID_TYPE, ID where
    ID_TYPE is WMO, DCNN, ICAO, RAIN, WIND, CLBD or LPMS. See section
    3.6 for more details.
    <P><B><I>Observation time or period</I></B>
    <P>MIDAS does not use the Database Management System&#146;s representation
    of time. Where an observation is valid at a specific instant,
    that date/time is defined by the 4 attributes OB_YEAR, OB_MONTH,
    OB_DAY and OB_TIME. Where an observation is valid over a period
    of time that period is defined by the date/time at the end of
    the period (OB_YEAR, OB_MONTH, OB_DAY and OB_END_TIME) plus an
    hour count or day count (OB_HOUR_COUNT, OB_DAY_COUNT).
    <P><B><I>Met Domain</I></B>
    <P>The Met Domain specifies the source of the observations in
    the record. Typically it will identify the message type by which
    the observations were received (e.g. SYNOP, NCM). Observations
    under one Met Domain may be spread across a number of tables;
    for instance, the daily observations from a climate station entered
    on Form 3208 are stored in up to 6 MIDAS tables under Met Domain
    DLY3208. Met Domain is a key attribute in the Source Capability
    table. Met Domains in use for UK surface records are listed below:

    <P>Where quality control is performed and changes are made to
    the observed value to correct for errors it is important that
    the original value is not lost. When a change is made to any
    value in a table record, the original record is stored with Version
    Number 0 and a new record is created for the corrected version
    having version number 1. Any further changes are made to version
    number 1, so that at any time no more than 2 versions exist,
    the original and the current best version. On initial storage
    all new records are given Version Number 1. A table will not
    have Version Number as an attribute if no quality control is
    ever performed on the observations (e.g. CLIMAT data, sub-hourly
    rainfall).
    <P><B><I>Observed Value</I></B>
    <P>In many cases the observed value is stored as received though
    some processing of raw data or conversion from outdated measuring
    units may have been performed. The table below gives detail of
    the storage units, while all processing is described in section
    5 above.

    The data are stored in MIDAS under met domain AWSHRLY or AWSDLY
    in the same way as for other CDL stations, except that different

  <P><A NAME="7"></A><h1>7. Quality control</h1> Quality control
  processes performed on MIDAS data
  <P><B><I>Quality control at the point of observation</I></B>
  <P>Basic quality control is performed at each observing site
  which ensures that some errors are trapped before being transmitted.
  In the days before automation, the trained observer was required
  to check all his entries in the weather register, and these practices
  continue in the few islands of manual observing that exist today.
  Observing system software applies a range of checks to all reported
  parameters which ensure that no irregular values leave the site,
  however, the human observer, if present at the time of observation,
  may override many of the queries raised.
  <P><B><I>MetDB quality checks</I></B>
  <P>All real time observations that are destined for MIDAS are
  stored first in the MetDB. These include SYNOP, NCM, HCM, SREW
  and METAR reports. Some range and self-consistency checks are
  performed on the values at the point of receipt in the MetDB
  and the associated flags are passed to MIDAS on data ingestion
  by setting the query flag equal to 1.
  <P><B><I>Ingestion checks</I></B>
  <P>All data on ingestion to MIDAS undergo basic range checks.
  These do no more than ensure that the meteorological value does
  not lie outside long-term climatological extremes (taking no
  account of time of year or location). Those failing have query
  flag set equal to 2.
  <P><B><I>QCL checks</I></B>
  <P>All UK surface data, with the exception of rainfall data,
  undergo a set of &quot;QCL&quot; checks soon after their ingestion
  into MIDAS. A level flag set equal to 1 indicates that QCL checks
  have been performed. These checks ensure:
  <UL>
    <LI>The widest possible self-consistency between the elements
    in each message
    <LI>Consistency with climatological extremes (location dependent)
    <LI>Consistency with previous observations from the same source;
    i.e. range checks are applied to the rate of change of the parameter
  </UL>
  <P><B><I>Checks against neighbours</I></B>
  <P>Automatic algorithms are applied to certain meteorological
  elements to ensure consistency with neighbours (areal checks).
  The elements checked are maximum and minimum air temperatures,
  grass minimum temperatures, 0900 air temperature, rainfall and
  sunshine. A buddy check of mean hourly wind is also performed
  Where there are no automatic checks of the climate elements basic
  manual checks are performed.
  <P><B><I>Manual quality control</I></B>
  <P>With few exceptions, all quality control flags raised by the
  checks are scrutinised by trained meteorological staff in the
  QC Teams at Bracknell and Edinburgh. It is their decision whether
  the status flag is set or not; where errors are found corrections
  are supplied and where values are missing estimates are made.
  <P><B><I>The final sweep</I></B>
  <P>To ensure no spurious values have escaped the processes described
  above, a final sweep through the observations is made in order
  to trap any remaining gross errors.
