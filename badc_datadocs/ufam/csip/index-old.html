Introduction</H2>

<P>The goal of the Convective Storm Initiation Project (CSIP) is to understand the 
mechanisms responsible for the initiation of precipitating convection in the maritime, 
environment of southern England; i.e. to understand why convective clouds form and 
develop into precipitating clouds in a particular location. 
<p>The project will be 
centred on the 3 GHz (CAMRa) and 1275 clear-air (ACROBAT) radars at Chilbolton. A 
number of the new UK Universities' Facility for Atmospheric Measurement (UFAM) 
mobile instruments will be deployed within the range of the radars. These include three 
sodars, a Doppler Lidar, a wind profiler, an aerosol and ozone lidar, a network of 
automatic weather stations, mobile radiosonde stations and a Cessna aircraft. The main 
project will be conducted in June, July and August 2005. A <a href="pilot.html">pilot project</a> was 
conducted in July 2004.

Availability of data
</h2>

<p>
Data is is currently being collected and submitted to the BADC. The data is located in the 
<a
href="http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/csip/data">CSIP
archive</a> and is currently available only to individuals associated with the campaign.
</p>
Data has been collected by many data providers and organisations and is stored centrally at the BADC. 
CSIP participants can apply for access to the archive to view the data.
Please see the <a href="csipaccess.html">Instructions for accessing data</a> webpage for details.

Data, software and metadata submission
</h2>



If you are a data provider, please read the
<a href="submission.html">submission instructions</a> and notes on the 
<a href="http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/help/file_naming.html">filenaming convention</a>
before using the BADC
<a href="../../upload.html">data file uploader</a>.  <p>
The data are stored in NetCDF and NASA-Ames <a href="/help/formats/">formats</a>.
  If you wish to check that files are correctly formatted before uploading them 
please use the <a href="http://titania.badc.rl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/cf-checker.pl">
NetCDF format checker</a> or <a href="http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dataex_file.cgi.pl">
NASA-Ames format checker</a>.
It is important that the data be well documented.
Please follow the BADC guidelines regarding the submission of
<a href="/help/metadata/">metadata</a>.
<p>Many data files contain the variable <i>time</i> which can be expressed in 
several ways. Guidelines on the <a href="http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/help/formats/NASA-Ames/nasa-ames-time.htm"> 
recommended format of the time-variable</a>  header lines, units and the data values in 
Nasa-Ames files are available and are based on the format used in NetCDF.

<li>A <a href="http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/csip/data/ukmo-nrt/csip-nrt.html">
CSIP UKMO campaign support page</a> has been created which has links to current images provided 
by the UK Met Office. Access to this page requires acceptance of conditions laid down by the 
Met Office. Project participants can apply 
<a href="http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dataset_registration/dataset_info.cgi.pl?datasetid=csipukmo">here</a>.

<li>A <a href="http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/msg/data/hritimages/latest/latest_msg.html">
CSIP MSG campaign support page</a> has been created which has links to current images from the MSG satellite. 
Access to this page requires acceptance of conditions laid down by the 
Met Office and EUMETSAT. Project participants can apply 
<a href="http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dataset_registration/dataset_info.cgi.pl?datasetid=msg">here</a>.

<li><a href="http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/csip/data/ecmwf-charts">
ECMWF forecast images for precipitation and cloud cover</a> are available to CSIP participants. 
Access to the images requires acceptance of conditions laid down by the 
ECMWF and the Met Office. If not done so already, this involves completing an online application which includes the Met Office and ECMWF 
agreements under which the BADC has acquired the data. Project participants can apply 
<a href="http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dataset_registration/dataset_info.cgi.pl?datasetid=ecmwffor">here</a>.

<li>Freely available medium range forecasts are available from the <a href="http://www.ecmwf.int/products/forecasts/d/charts/medium/deterministic/msl_uv850_z500">
ECMWF site</a>. These provide pressure and wind speed fields.

<li>An online <a href="/community/workspaces.html">workspace</a> has been created
for <i>CSIP</i> participants in order to ease cross-project
coordination and exchange of views, information and preliminary data.
The workspace is only accessible to the project participants who have been
invited.
