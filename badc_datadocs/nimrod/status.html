<br>1-18/08/2008  Several thousand files in the archive, generally from 2004 and 2005, had a date in the filename that was shifted by usually a day from the date given in the data. These have been corrrected, but some image files from this period will still be misnamed and this is visible by comparing to other images from the same day.
<br>18/08/2008  The archive was re-arranged at the top level to give a clearer structure
