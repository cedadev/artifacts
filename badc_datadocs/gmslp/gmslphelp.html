<H3><A NAME="intro"></A>1. Introduction:</H3>

<P>There has long been a requirement for a reliable global gridded
dataset of observed mean sea level (MSL) pressure, that would
be suitable for both analysing climate variability and for vaildating
climate model output. One of the earliest attempts to map global
MSL pressure was made by Buchan (1868), who mapped mean monthly
MSL pressure for 1857-1866, based on observations derived from
a representative sample of 360 stations worldwide. Notable work
in this field was carried out by Lamb and Johnson (1966), who
published contoured global charts of January and July MSL pressure
for each year in 1750-1966. However existing gridded MSL pressure
data sets generally have a restricted coverage, being either hemispheric
or 'near-global' and consist mostly of analysed data derived from
hand-drawn analyses in pre-computer era and more recently from
routine GCM (Global Circulation Model) operational analyses or
reanalyses. Also owing to the change of analysis technique, these
data sets are unlikely to be homogeneous. Although there are several
'observed' MSL pressure data sets available, which are either
blends of analysed and observed data or statistical reconstructions
based on observations, none of these has global coverage.</P>

<P>GMSLP is a global, observed, monthly historical MSL pressure
data set, which has been developed in collaboration with CSIRO
and NIWA. The data set begins in 1871 and is composed of gridded
values on a 5&deg; latitude and 5&deg; longitude resolution, centred
on whole multiples of 5&deg;, e.g. 55&deg;N, 5&deg;N. It has been
constructed from a blend of existing gridded datasets provided
by the UK Met. Office, NCAR, Scripps Institute of Oceanography
(SIO), University of East Anglia (UEA) and CSIRO; plus observed
data extracted from the UKMO Marine Data Bank, Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere
Data set (COADS), UKMO monthly CLIMAT message archives and land
station time series.</P>

<P>A key use of GMSLP is in the multivariate analysis of results
of atmospheric model simulations of recent climate, aimed at detecting
climate change and attributing it to human activities. Thus, simulations
of historical surface pressure given observed sea surface temperatures
and increasing greenhouse gases, sulphate aerosols, etc..., are
being compared with observations and used to help interpret simulated
air temperature changes. A further aim of GMSLP is to facilitate
the validation of other atmospheric model results. GMSLP is also
being used in the interpretation of observed global and regional
climate variations. Particular examples are: variations in the
El Ni&ntilde;o Southern Oscillation, variations in south Pacific
atmospheric circulation in observations and in atmospheric model
simulations, and the effect of atmospheric circulation on land
surface air temperature patterns. The dataset will allow an improved
assessment of the effects of atmospheric circulation changes on
UK climate and therefore a more thorough interpretation, for the
UK area, of model simulations with increasing greenhouse gases.</P>

<P>NCAR and UKMO are both Northern Hemisphere data sets based
on 5&deg; by 5&deg; area and 5&deg; latitude by 10&deg; longitude
grids respectively.</P>

<P>The CSIRO data set is a 'near global' data set, based on a
10&deg; by 10&deg; area grid, constructed from a blend of land
observations extracted from historical station records and marine
observations from COADS.</P>

<P>The SIO data set (Barnett et al., 1984) also has 'near global'
coverage, but on a 5&deg; latitude by 10&deg; longitude grid.
These data were derived from a variety of different sources, including
MSL pressure analyses from various national weather centres and
raw ships' observations.</P>

<P>The data sets provided by Jones and Wigley (1988) and Jones
(1991) are both limited area 5&deg; latitude by 10&deg; longitude
grids covering part of the Southern Hemisphere. They are based
solely on land station observations, which were interpolated onto
'hemespheric' grids using regression techniques.</P>

<H3><A NAME="creation"></A>3. Creation of GMSLP2.1.</H3>

<P>Although GMSLP2.0 consisted of a globally complete individual
MSL pressure field for every month for 1871-1994, it was heavily
dependent on the component gridded analyses. To develop and further
improve the GMSLP data set, the UK Met. Office introduced observed
data directly.These data were a blend of marine observations from
the UKMOMDB and COADS and land station time series from CSIRO,
NIWA and the UKMO CLIMAT archive. The observations were blended
with GMSLP2.0 to create GMSLP2.1 .</P>

<P>Several versions of GMSLP2.1 data were created. GMSLP2.1c was
the first published version but it was found to suffer from bias
over the tropical oceans,owing to over-correcting marine data
for standard gravity. A revised correction scheme was devised
and applied to the marine data, ultimately resulting in GMSLP2.1f,
which is the most recent version of the data set.</P>

<P>More detailed information about the creation and analysis of
this dataset is available from <EM>&quot;Development of the Global
Mean Sea Level Pressure Data Set GMSLP2&quot;</EM> by T.A. BAsnett
and D.E.Parker, 1997.</P>

<H3><A NAME="conclu"></A>4. Conclusion</H3>

<P>GMSLP2.1f is the most recent version of the Global Mean Sea-Level
Pressure dataset. GMSLP2.1 is more reliable than GMSLP1.2, as
it is strongly influenced by quality controlled observed data.
GMSLP2.1f, or preceeding versions, has already been used in various
analyses, especially studies of ENSO and for model validation.
However there remain several weaknesses, namely the necessity
of using climatology in data-sparse regions, especially in the
Southern Hemisphere, together with a lack of reliable observations
in the earlier decades. Some initial problems with the quality-control
of several key land-station time series led to the introduction
of noise into early versions of the data set: adjustments have
been applied but further improvements need to be made. The problem
of noisy data is relatively insignificant on a global scale, but
for some regional studies it has been found that band-pass filtered
data are of more use.</P>

<P>A completely new GMSLP3 is planned. This will use a background
field based on EOF reconstruction techniques, developed by Rayner
et al. (1996) for the creation of the GISST data set. By using
such techniques, the UK Met. Office hope to remove the need for
a background field reliant on other data sets and therefore eliminate
much of the bias that has affected the creation of GMSLP2.1.
