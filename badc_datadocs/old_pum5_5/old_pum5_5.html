		<h2><img src="/graphics/blue/info.gif" border="0" align="BOTTOM">Introduction</h2>

This dataset contains Version 5.5 of the Ported Unified Model Software (PUM) from the UK Met Office. This allows the Unified Model to be run on a user's own system. This is currently the most up-to-date version available of the PUM supersededing <a href="/data/pum/">version 4.5</a>. The archive also contains community contributions associated with the PUM5.5. 
		
<p>The Unified Model is the name given to the suite of atmospheric and oceanic numerical modelling software developed and used at the Met Office. The model supports global and regional domains and a wide range of temporal and spatial scales that allow it to be used for numerical weather prediction as well as a variety of related research activities. This software allows the Unified Model to be run on a user's own system. More information detail about the Ported Unified Model Version 5.5 is available on the <a href="http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/nwp/numerical/unified_model/external.html">Met Office PUM5.5 web page</a>.
<p><b>Please note that this is the MODEL SOFTWARE ONLY, not the UM model output, which is at http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/um/</b></p>
