<H2>1. <A NAME="instrument"></A>The Instrument</H2>

<P>This is a brief, simplified outline of the ISAMS instrument
and the measurement techniques which are employed. Users requiring
a more detailed description of the design and operation of the
instrument should consult the paper by <A HREF="references.html">Taylor
et al. (1993).</A> 

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>1.1 <A NAME="description"></A>Instrument Description</H3>

<P>ISAMS is an infrared radiometer which measures thermal emission
from the Earth's limb. Measurements are made in eight channels
in the 4-17 microns range using pressure modulation and wideband
radiometric techniques to select regions of the spectrum appropriate
to the species to be measured. 

<P>The instrument observes the earth's limb in a direction normal
to the orbital track (with a small offset to correct for the Doppler
shift due to the Earth's rotation). The tangent point is a great
circle distance of approximately 23&deg; (approx. 2500km) away
from the sub-satellite track. 

<P>A switching mirror is included in the optical path to allow
the instrument to view the limb on either side of the spacecraft
velocity vector, but in practice viewing on the &quot;Sun-side&quot;
of the spacecraft is limited to periods when the Sun is behind
the Earth so that solar radiation cannont enter the instrument. 

<P>The primary optics of the instrument focus the radiation onto
a chopper which modulates between the Earth's limb and cold space
at a frequency of 1kHz, giving a zero-radiance reference signal.
The gain is measured relative to an internal black body calibration
source at 290K. 

<P>The incoming beam is divided into 8 separate pressure modulator
channels, each of which contains a sample of the gas to be measured.
ISAMS uses pressure-modulator cells for each of the following
gases : CO<sub>2</sub> (times 2), CO, CH<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O, NO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O. The two
CO<sub>2</sub> channels can be operated at different pressures which ensures
that temperature measurements may be made over a extended range. 

<P>Each of the two CO<sub>2</sub> channels also contains a filter wheel to
allow wideband measurements of three key chemical species - ozone
(O<sub>3</sub>), nitric acid (HNO<sub>3</sub>) and dinitrogen pentoxide (N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>) - none
of which can be isolated in a gas cell. There is also a `window'
channel at 12.1 microns which is relatively free of molecular
absorption and can be used in the retrieval of aerosol opacities. 

<H3>1.2 <A NAME="techniques"></A>Measurement Techniques</H3>

<P>The measurement technique used by ISAMS is known as Pressure
Modulation Radiometry. The incoming radiation in each channel
passes through a cell containing a sample of the gas to be measured,
in which the pressure is modulated at a frequency of about 30Hz. 

<P>A multi-layer interference filter in front of the detector
restricts the radiation reaching the detector to a narrow part
of the vibration-rotation band of the relevant species. 

<P>The signal processing electronics demodulates the signal from
the detector at the chopper frequency to give a wideband signal
for the spectral band defined by the interference filter. This
&quot;wideband&quot; signal is then further demodulated at the
pressure modulation frequency. This pressure modulated signal
originates in or near the spectral lines of the species in the
gas cell and is therefore very selective for radiation originating
from that species in the atmosphere. 

<H3>1.3 <A NAME="process"></A>Data Processing Techniques</H3>

<P>The <A HREF="/data/uars/">UARS</A> data processing is carried
out at the <A HREF="http://www-uars.gsfc.nasa.gov/" TARGET="_top">Central
Data Handling Facility</A> at the Goddard Space Flight Center
using software supplied by the Instrument's Principal Investigator
group. 

<P>The data processing for UARS instruments consists of a progression
through a sequence of `levels' from the raw telemetry at level
0 to geophysical quantities interpolated onto standard grids at
level 3. The processing steps for ISAMS are outlined below : 

<DL>
 <P> <DT><STRONG>Level 1 processing</STRONG>
  <DD>At the level 0-1 processing step, instrument-specific effects
  are removed and a set of calibrated data are derived in physical
  units (eg. voltages and radiances) tagged with their locations.
 <P> <DT><STRONG>Level 2 processing</STRONG>
  <DD>The level 1 data are then processed further to produce the
  level 2 product which contains vertical profiles of temperature,
  pressure and mixing ratios of chemical constituents at the measurement
  positions. This step involves a complex inversion algorithm which
  consists of two principal stages :
  <P>Firstly the temperature and pressure are retrieved using the
  radiances from the CO<sub>2</sub> channels, using a sequential estimation
  scheme, or Kalman filter, similar to that described by Rodgers
  et al (1984) for SAMS data. This method combines the radiance
  data with retrievals from neighbouring profiles and with climatology
  to produce a statistically optimal result.
  <P>The temperatures and pressures are then combined with the
  data from the constituent channels to retrieve vertical profiles
  of the constituents using a maximum likelihood estimator.
 <P> <DT><STRONG>Level 3A processing</STRONG>
  <DD>The level 2 data are profiles located at the measurement
  positions which are determined by the scan pattern and by the
  track of the tangent point. The level 2-3A processing step takes
  these data and interpolates them onto a standard set of vertical
  levels -- evenly spaced in log pressure, and onto standard times
  (level 3AT) and standard latitudes (level 3AL).

<H3><A NAME="horizontal"></A>2.1. Horizontal Range</H3>

<P>Views of the limb from the UARS orbit extend to approximately
10&deg; of the pole. To achieve maximum latitude coverage, the
instrument views at right angles to the orbit track. 

<P>A switching mirror allows the instrument to observe on either
side of the orbital track, so that in principle the coverage could
extend from 80&deg;N to 80&deg;S, every day. In practice, viewing
is only possible from the Sun-viewing side of the spacecraft when
the Sun is behind the Earth, so that solar radiation cannot enter
the instrument. Generally, therefore the coverage is restricted
to the anti-Sun side of the spacecraft between 34&deg; in one
hemisphere and 80&deg; in the other. 

<P>The spacecraft performs a 180&deg; yaw approximately every
36 days so that the spacecraft orientation relative to the velocity
vector is reversed. (eg. the spacecraft flies `backwards' rather
than `forwards'). 

<P>Each spacecraft yaw manoeuvre changes the coverage from high
latitudes in one hemisphere to high latitudes in the other. Thus,
when the spacecraft files `forwards', the coverage is 80&deg;S
 to 34&deg;N, and when it flies `backwards' the coverage is
80&deg;N to 34&deg;S. 

<P>The latitudinal coverage of the ISAMS instrument is compared
with the other UARS instruments in <A HREF="/data/uars/figures/uars_lat_coverage.html">Figure
2.</A>

<H3><A NAME="vertical"></A>2.2. Vertical Range</H3>
<P>The vertical range depends on measured parameters.


<H3><A NAME="temporal"></A>2.3 Temporal Range</H3>

<P>ISAMS operated from shortly after the UARS launch in October
1991 until the end of July 1992 when failure of the instrument's
chopper halted operations. However there were several periods
within these dates when the collection of data ceased because
of operational difficulties. These are summarised below :
