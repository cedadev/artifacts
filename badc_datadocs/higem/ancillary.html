<p>To be able to upload and download ancillary files for HiGEM you will
need to have a valid BADC account and have access to HiGEM data.
&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Upload the ancillary file to the BADC</h2>
<p>This can be done in one of two ways.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
         ftp:
     ftp to ftp.badc.rl.ac.uk, cd to /incoming/higem/ancil and put the file
  </li>
  <li>The BADC file
  <a href="http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/cgi-bin/fileuploader/fileuploader?package=HIGEM_ANC">uploader</a>.
  The file uploader is a www based tool that will allow you to copy files from 
  your local disk to the BADC using a simple web page.  There are limits on file sizes
  that can be moved using this www based method. If you get a message that says 
  you are trying to upload too much data then you should try the ftp method.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>During the upload the ancillary file will go into a temporary holding
space at the BADC (in the directory /incoming/higem/ancil). 
You can upload more than one file into the temporary holding space before
going on to ingest the files into the HiGEM ancillary archive.</p>
<h2>Ingest the file into the Ancillary Archive</h2>
<p>This stage performs some checking on the contents of the file, assigns 
an ancillary type, such as orography or vegetation to the file, allows
you to set a version for the file, and finally moves the file to 
the HiGEM ancillary file archive.</p>

<p>The ingestion is controlled by the 
<A href="http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/cgi-bin/higem/ancils/upload_v">HiGEM ancillary</A>
web page  There is a link to this page from the BADC file uploader, labelled
 'Ingest Ancillary Files'.</p>
 <ol>
 <li>Find the file to ingest.  The HiGEM ancillary web page allows you to browse around
 the temporary space at the BADC to find the file you want to ingest.</li>
 <li>Set the file type.  The HiGEM ancillary web page will check the contents of the
 ancillary file and, if it can, use these to determine the ancillary type.  If it can not
 determine the ancillary type, for instance if this is the first time that a file
 of this type has been uploaded then you will be given a chance to set the type.</li>
 <li>Set the file version.  A file version will be suggested on the form, you may set your
 own version number.  This should be a decimal digit.  How the version numbers are
 managed is up to you.  A suggestion is to increment the most significant digit only when
 major revisions have occurred.</li>
 <li>Move the file to the BADC archive.  This stage is done automatically.  The files
 are moved to a location /badc/higem/data/ancil/vnn.m, where n.m is the version number.</li>
 </ol>

<H2>Add any notes on the ancillary files to the Workspace</H2>
<p>If you have any notes on the ancillary file you have uploaded you can add these
to the <A href="http://bscw.badc.nerc.ac.uk/bscw/bscw.cgi/0/26896">workspace</A>.
You may add notes in text or word or as links to www pages.  Notes should be added
to the workspace with names that reflect the file type and version 
e.g. file_type_version.  Other comments about the ancillaries can be added to the 
workspace, either by modifying the notes, by adding new documents, or through a
workspace discussion.</p>
