GICE contains monthly mean global ice concentration data on 1
degree grids. <BR>
<BR>
GICE describes data which are derived from Walsh Sea_Ice Concentration
data. <BR>
Sophisticated statistical methods are used to produce a global
coverage of monthly one-degree-area sea-ice coverage: Rayner,
N.A, et al 1996. (See ref. 8). <BR>
<BR>
Note that because there are very little ice data (if any) for
the period 1871-1900, a climatology of 1901-30 was used to estimate
the ice concentrations for 1871-1900. <BR>
<BR>
Ice concentrations are in tenths of gridbox covered with ice (0-9)
and the period of the data is January 1871 to January 2003. <BR>
