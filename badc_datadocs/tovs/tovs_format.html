<P>Each dataset contains analysed atmospheric radiances from a
number of radiance channels on a global grid for each day in a
month. The radiances are for the following radiometer channels:

<P>The global grid is a regular latitude - longitude grid of grid
length 5 degrees. There are 37 latitudes from 90 degrees N to
90 degrees S and 72 longitudes from 180 degrees W to 175 degrees
E. 

<P>The radiances are obtained from analysis of radiances supplied
on an orbital grid by NOAA/NESDIS (as described in Section 2.2
Stage 2.6). 

<P>Each day's data consists of 38 records. The first record contains
header information about the data while the other 37 records contain
the radiances. The days are in chronological order. 

<P>There are 1080 items in each record Each item is of type integer
* 2. Note that data are scaled as indicated in <A HREF="#rad_note4">Note
4</A>. 

<P>Missing data are indicated by the value -32768. 

<P>The formats of the 38 records are given in the following sections:

<P>The heights are for the levels: 

<PRE>
        850, 500, 300, 200, 100, 50, 20, 10, 5, 2, 1 HPa </PRE>

length 50. There are 37 latitudes from 90 degrees N to 90 degrees
S and 72 longitudes from 180 degrees W to 175 degrees E. 

<P>The tropospheric heights (up to and including the 50 Hpa level)
are obtained from an operational global analysis, while the stratospheric
heights are calculated from the 100 Hpa operational analysis heights
and sets of thicknesses on an orbital grid. The latter are retrieved
from orbital radiances as measured by HIRS-2, MSU and SSU sounding
units. 

<P>Each day's data consists of 38 records. The first record contains
header information about the data, while the other 37 records
contain the heights. The days are in chronological order.
