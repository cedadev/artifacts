<H2><A NAME="introduction"></A>1. Introduction</H2>

<P>These data consist of sets of 3-dimensional gridpoint analyses
of the stratosphere which are produced by the <A HREF="http://www.metoffice.com/"
TARGET="_top">Met Office </A>using data from the
TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder 
instruments onboard the NOAA operational polar orbiters. The analyses
are usually refered to as the SSU analyses, but this is slightly
misleading since they use data from all three of the TOVS sub-instruments
<EM>not</EM> just the SSU. 

<P>The primary products which are archived at the BADC are synoptic
maps of measured radiances and geopotential height. The radiances
are stored on a 5 degree latitude by 5 degree longitude grid,
whilst the geopotential heights are stored on the same grid on
the 850, 500, 300, 200, 100, 50, 20, 10, 5, 2 and 1 hPa pressure
surfaces. Both datasets are produced daily at 1200 UTC. The analyses
have been produced from December 1978 to June 1998. 

<P><A HREF="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/ukmo-tovs/software/">Software</A> is available
to calculate brightness temperatures from the radiances and temperatures
and geostrophic winds and potential vorticity from the geopotential
height fields. 

<H2><A NAME="system"></A>2. The Analysis System</H2>

<H3><A NAME="instruments"></A>2.1 Instrument Descriptions</H3>

<P>The TOVS system has been flown on successive spacecraft in
the TIROS-N/NOAA series of Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellites
(POES) since 1978. TOVS consists of 3 sub-instruments which make
measurements of radiance from the Earth over a large portion of
the electromagnetic spectrum from the microwave to the visible: 

<UL>
  <LI>The Stratospheric Sounding Unit (SSU) uses the technique
  of pressure modulation radiometry to measure radiation emitted
  by CO2 3 channels in the infra-red. This instrument has the highest
  vertical resolution in the stratosphere.
  <LI>The High-Resolution Infrared Sounder makes measurements in
  19 regions of the infrared spectrum between 3.7 and 15 microns.
  <LI>The Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) measures thermal microwave
  radiation in the 4 regions of the oxygen emission spectrum at
  around 50GHz.
</UL>

<P>All three instruments scan perpendicular to the orbital path
which greatly improves their vertical resolution, although they
use different scanning patterns. The SSU (which was built by the
Met Office) is described in detail in <A HREF="references.html#pick">Pick
and Brownscombe</A> (1981), whilst <A HREF="references.html#schwalb">Schwalb
(1978)</A> gives a description of the TOVS system as a whole. 

<P>The Met Office analyses use a total of 8 channels from all
three instruments. SSU channels 25, 26 and 27, which have weighting
functions peaking near 15, 5 and 1.5 hPa respectively, HIRS channels
1, 2 and 3 which have broad weighting functions spanning much
of the stratosphere and MSU channels 23 and 24 which peak in the
lower stratosphere. The Spatial distribution of the weighting
functions is shown in <A HREF="tovs_weight_fn.html">Fig.1</A> 

<H3><A NAME="analysis"></A>2.2 Analysis Technique</H3>

<P>The Met Office uses 8 of the channels from the TOVS analyses
to calculate 5 deep layer thicknesses in the stratosphere: 100-20,
100-10, 100-5, 100-2 and 100-1 hPa. Thicknesses rather than temperatures
are retrieved because of the low vertical resolution of the soundings. 

<P>The analysis process may be divided into two distinct stages. 

<DL>
  <DT><STRONG>I. Calculation of regression Coefficients</STRONG>
  <DD>A first preparatory step involves the calculation of regression
  coefficients to derive a linear relationship giving thicknesses
  in terms of radiances.
  <DT><STRONG>II. Operational Data Processing</STRONG>
  <DD>This relationship is then used operationally to retrieve
  thicknesses from the radiances measured by TOVS. The thicknesses
  are interpolated to give synoptic thickness maps on a regular
  grid. Geopotential heights are then obtained by adding thicknesses
  to an independently analysed field of geopotential height at
  100hPa.
</DL>

<P>These stages are outlined in more detail in the following sections. 

<H3><A NAME="regression"></A>2.3 Calculation of Regression of
Coefficients</H3>

<P>In order to use the satellite radiances to calculate thicknesses
and and hence geopotential heights, a linear equation is derived
which gives the thicknesses in terms of radiances. This is achieved
by using a reference set of rocket profiles. For each of the reference
profiles a set of simulated radiances (which would have been measured
by a coincident satellite sounding) is calculated. These are used
in conjunction with the measured thicknesses to derive a set of
linear equations for the calculation of thickness from radiance.
These equations may then be used to calculate thicknesses operationally. 

<P>The rocket profiles used in the calculation are a reference
set of 1200 which were obtained from the NOAA/NMC Upper Air Branch.
The profiles are divided into 7 zones by latitude, and a radiance-thickness
expression is derived for each zone separately. There are three
zones in the winter extra-tropics, three in the summer extra-tropics
(each 20 degrees wide) and one tropical zone (60 degrees wide).
There is no distinction between the hemispheres, biasing the <EM>a
priori</EM> in favour of the northern hemisphere where the majority
of the rocket ascents took place. Note that reference set of rocket
soundings includes profiles representative of winter warming conditions. 

<P>The radiance-thickness expressions are recalculated for each
new satellite and also if there is a change in the number of operational
channels in the TOVS subsystem, or if there is a significant change
(&gt; 10%) in the gas-cell pressure in one of the SSU channels. 

<H3><A NAME="operational"></A>2.4 Operational Data Processing
Steps</H3>

<P>The data used to calculate the analyses are supplied to the
Met Office by NOAA/NESDIS. The routine processing of the data
involves the following steps. 

<OL>
  <LI><STRONG>Interpolation of HIRS and MSU data</STRONG><BR>
  HIRS and MSU data are interpolated onto SSU fields of view by
  locating the nearest 4 HIRS/MSU radiances to each SSU viewing
  position. This step effectively means that all three instruments
  can be considered to provide data at common viewing angles. (5,15,25
  and 35 degrees off nadir).
  <LI><STRONG>Quality Control</STRONG><BR>
  A spike check is made by taking the mean and standard deviation
  of all radiances in a block of data. All radiances further than
  three standard deviations from the mean are rejected.
  <LI><STRONG>Grouping into &quot;Superobs&quot;</STRONG><BR>
  The 8x8 observations from the 8 different viewing angles are
  grouped into 4x4 fields of view by combining 4 adjacent observations
  into a single observation known as a &quot;superob&quot;. The
  superobs are centred at angles 10 and 30 degrees either side
  of the nadir.
  <LI><STRONG>Nadir corrections</STRONG><BR>
  The off-nadir SSU radiances are corrected to a nadir view by
  using a pre-computed matrix correction. (Note that the HIRS and
  MSU radiances are corrected to nadir at NESDIS).
  <LI><STRONG>Retrieval of thicknesses</STRONG><BR>
  For each nadir-corrected 8-channel radiance vector, pre-calculated
  (see section 1.3 above) regression coefficients are used to calculate
  thicknesses for the standard layers 100-20, 100-10, 100-5, 100-2
  and 100-1hPa. The regression coefficients chosen depend on the
  latitude band of the measurement, and the values are varied sinusoidally
  to allow for the seasonal cycle.
  <LI><STRONG>Interpolation onto a global grid at 12GMT.</STRONG><BR>
  Radiances and retrieved thicknesses are linearly interpolated
  in both space and time onto a regular 5 degree latitude by 5
  degree longitude grid at 12 GMT. The value at each grid point
  is calculated from all observations within 500km and within 12
  hours of 12 GMT.
  <LI><STRONG>Filling in missing values</STRONG><BR>
  Where there is missing radiance data, grid points may have no
  data assigned to them. In this case a search is performed over
  20 grid lengths for valid data and linear interpolation is used.
  If no data is found within this range then a global mean value
  is substituted. Note that the number of missing grid points is
  recorded in the file header and if more that 650 points are missing
  then the day's analysis should be discarded.
  <LI><STRONG>Analyses of Geopotential Height</STRONG><BR>
  Global fields of geopotential height for the stratosphere are
  constructed by adding the gridded thicknesses to an objective
  analysis of geopotential height at 100hPa. This analysis comes
  from an operational weather forecasting centre (either the 
  Met Office or the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts).
  This analysis also provides the data fields for the tropospheric
  levels. The result of this process is a set of geopotential heights
  at 850, 500, 300, 200, 100, 50, 20, 10, 5, 2 and 1 hPa.
  <LI><STRONG>Smoothing</STRONG><BR>
  The gridded fields of radiances, thicknesses and heights are
  then smoothed in the horizontal by Fourier analysis. Zonal wavenumbers
  greater than 12 are discarded and the Fourier coefficients of
  remaining zonal wavenumbers are smoothed by discarding pole-to-pole
  wavenumbers greater than 12. This is a compromise between almost
  complete coverage at high latitudes and much poorer coverage
  at lower latitudes (<A HREF="tovs_weight_fn.html">See
  Fig. 1a.</A>)
</OL>

<H2><A NAME="data"></A>3. The Data</H2>

<P>This section contains a brief summary of the information in
the Hadley Centre Climate Research Technical Note (CRTN24) on
the TOVS analyses <A HREF="references.html">(Bailey et al., 1992).</A>
You are strongly advised to consult this document before using the data. 

<H3><A NAME="spatial"></A>3.1 Spatial Coverage</H3>

<H4>3.1.1 Vertical Coverage</H4>

<P>The Geopotential height data are available on a set of levels
from 850 to 1 hPa. For the levels available see the section on
resolution below. Radiance data are available for the 8 channels
of the TOVS instruments which are used in the Met Office Analysis
system. For the weighting functions for these channels refer to
<A HREF="tovs_weight_fn.html">Fig. 1b</A>. 

<H4>3.1.2 Horizontal Coverage</H4>

<P>The geopotential height and radiance data are both stored on
a grid which covers the whole globe. For further information,
see the section below on the data resolution. 

<H3><A NAME="temporal"></A>3.2 Temporal Coverage</H3>

<P>The analyses are available from the BADC for a continuous period
from January 1979 to June 1998. There is a separate file for each month of data. 

<H3><A NAME="resolution"></A>3.3 Resolution</H3>

<P>Both the radiance and the geopotential height fields held at
the BADC are on a 5 degree by 5 degree latitude-longitude global
grid. There are 37 latitudes from 90 degrees N to 90 degrees S
and 72 longitudes from 180 degrees W to 180 degrees E. The geopotential
heights are stored on the following set of pressure levels: 

<P>850, 500, 300, 200, 100, 50, 20, 10, 5, 2 and 1 hPa 

<P>The Radiance data are supplied for up to 11 channels of the
TOVS instruments. 

<H3><A NAME="quality"></A>3.4 Data Quality</H3>

<P>The accuracy (precision and systematic biases) of stratospheric
analyses produced by Met Office is influenced by the following factors: 

<OL>
  <LI>The accuracy and stability of the measuring instruments.
  <LI>The vertical resolution of the measurements. This is limited
  by the width and overlap of weighting functions.
  <LI>The horizontal resolution of the measurements. This is limited
  by the number of satellite orbits and the angular range of side
  scanning.
  <LI>The retrieval method which derives thicknesses from radiances.
  The reference a priori data used in the retrieval cannot represent
  the full range of stratospheric conditions.
  <LI>The interpolation of observations. Errors inevitably arise
  when observations from orbits spread throughout the day are interpolated
  onto a regular latitude longitude grid at a specified synoptic
  time.
  <LI>The accuracy of the 100 HPa analysis which is used as a base
  level. Though operational weather forecasting centres such as
  the Met Office continue to improve their tropospheric analyses, errors
  remain as evidenced by differences between independently produced
  fields, particularly in the southern hemisphere where ground-based
  data are sparse.
</OL>

<P>The effect of each of these factors is difficult, if not impossible,
to assess definitively given the limited amounts (or complete
lack of) independent data for the middle and upper stratosphere.
The reliability of derived fields is strongly influenced locally
by the vertical and horizontal scales of the actual circulation. 

<P><A HREF="references.html">Bailey et al.</A> (1992) discuss a number of tests of the data quality and conclude that the
principal limitation is the inherently low vertical resolution,
which can blur comparatively small-scale baroclinic structures
in the stratosphere (especially during strong warmings), and which
can lead to discrepancies in diagnostic calculations, especially
when second (or higher) orders of spatial differentiation are
involved. 

<P>When examining data for a particular day, users are advised
to check the following indicators of data quality detailed in
the appendix: 

<OL>
  <LI>The coverage code, which gives information about the data
  used to produce the analysis.
  <LI>The number of missing grid points (for gridded data). If
  this exceeds 650, then consider rejecting that day.
  <LI>Missing data indicators, which show which fields, if any,
  are missing on a given day.
</OL>

<P>See the <A HREF="tovs_format.html">file format</A> document
for the locations of these parameters. 

<H2><A NAME="using"></A>4. Using TOVS analyses from the BADC</H2>

<P>The TOVS analyses are covered by a data protocol between the
Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) and the Met Office.
This is to allow the Met Office to keep track who is using the
data. 

<P>Since the dataset is restricted, it is not available anonymously
and cannot be accessed through the WWW. If you want to use the
data, please <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dataset_registration/dataset_info.cgi.pl?datasetid=tovs">apply 
for access to the Met Office TOVS data</a>.  <!-- Out of action at the moment

<H3><A NAME="transfer"></A>4.1 Transferring Data from the BADC</H3>

<P>All data and software is located beneath the directory <EM>/badc/ukmo-tovs</EM>.
Here you will find a README file and the following subdirectories 

<UL>
  <LI><A href="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/ukmo-tovs/doc/">doc</a> - contains Met Office documentation for the dataset.
  <LI><A href="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/ukmo-tovs/software/">software</a> - contains the example read software and any 3rd
  party software available
  <LI><A href="/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/ukmo-tovs/data/">data</a> - contains the data the original VMS binary files. This
  is the format supplied to us by the Met Office. The file format
  is simple, so the files are easily read on other platforms.
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="files"></A>4.4 Reading the data files</H3>

<H4><A NAME="structure"></A>4.4.1 File structure</H4>

<P>This section contains an overview of the file structures of
the TOVS radiance data and geopotential height analyses. The detailed
<A HREF="tovs_format.html">file formats</A> are also available
online. 

<P>The radiance and geopotential height datasets use a similar
file format. In both cases, the data are stored on a global grid
with a 5x5 degree resolution (37 latitudes for 90 degrees N to
90 degrees S and 72 longitudes from 180 degrees W to 180 degrees
E). For each grid-point, the radiance files contain the data for
the 8 channels used by the analyses, whilst the height files contain
the geopotential heights on the 11 pressure surfaces. 

<P>The data are stored in files which contain the data for a single
calendar month. Each day's data within the files contains 38 records,
consisting header record and 37 records, one for each latitiude
row. Days are stored in chronological order. 

<P>Schematically the files have the following structure: 

<P>&nbsp; 

<PRE>
      ______________________________
     | Day 1 : Header Record        |
     |______________________________|
     | Day 1 : 1st Latitude (90N)   |
     |______________________________|
     | Day 1 : 2nd Latitude (85N)   |
     |______________________________|
     | Day 1 : 3rd Latitude (80N)   |
     |______________________________|
     
               ............
     
      ______________________________
     | Day 1 : 37th Latitude (90S)  |

      ______________________________
     | Day N : 37th Latitude (90S)  |        N=Last day in the month
     |______________________________| </PRE>

<P>Each record contains 1080 data items of type integer*2. Missing
data has a value of -32768. The data is encoded to fit into the
arrays. If you are using the geopotential height analyses, then
you should multiply the raw values by a factor of 2 to get heights
in metres. The factors for the radiance data are channel dependent.
You should consult the <A HREF="tovs_format.html">format document</A>
to find out how to convert the data values to radiances. 

<H4><A NAME="routines"></A>4.4.2 Access Routines</H4>

<P>A set of FORTRAN subroutines to read the data are available
from the TOVS software directory at the BADC. These are the routines
supplied by the instrument team at the Met Office which should
compile and run on the majority of platforms. 

<P>A set of access routines written in IDL at the BADC is also
available. 

<H4><A NAME="3rdparty"></A>4.4.3 Third Party Software</H4>

<P>In the software directories for the TOVS data, there is a subdirectory
for 3rd Party software. If you develop software to use with the
TOVS data, then we encourage you to let us have a copy so that
we can make it available to other researchers.
