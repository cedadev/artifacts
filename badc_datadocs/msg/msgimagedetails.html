<A name=HRV></A><B>High Resolution Visible 
Imagery</B><BR><BR>This image shows the reflected solar radiation from the 
Earths surface and cloud tops at a spatial resolution equivalent to 1km at the 
sub-satellite point but increases for higher latitudes and longitudes away from 
the meridian. The images have been normalised by the solar zenith angle to 
remove changes in brightness during the day. They are available every 15 
minutes. The reflectance is averaged over a broad wavelength range in the 
visible part of the spectrum. Cloud shadows are clearly discernible at dawn and 
dusk giving an idea of the cloud top height. Aircraft contrails and ship tracks 
(in the cloud) can also be seen. <BR><BR>

<A name=VIS></A><B>Visible 
Imagery</B><BR><BR>This image shows the reflected solar radiation from the 
Earths surface and cloud tops at a spatial resolution equivalent to 3km at the 
sub-satellite point but increases for higher latitudes and longitudes away from 
the meridian. The images have been normalised by the solar zenith angle to 
remove changes in brightness during the day. They are available every 15 
minutes. The reflectance is over a narrower spectral band (centred at 0.8 
microns) than the high resolution visible channel and so the land surface will 
look brighter in this channel over vegetation and land surfaces in general. 
Cloud should look the same.<BR><BR>

<A name=IR></A><B>Infra-Red 
Imagery</B><BR><BR>This image shows emitted radiation from the Earths surface 
and cloud tops at a spatial resolution equivalent to 3km at the sub-satellite 
point but increases for higher latitudes and longitudes away from the meridian. 
They are available every 15 minutes. White areas denote cold temperatures and 
dark areas denote warm temperatures. Radiation from this channel is averaged 
over a narrow spectral band centred at 10.8 microns. At mid-latitudes the 
atmosphere is transparent at these wavelengths and so most of the radiation 
originates from the surface or cloud tops. The sea surface will not vary in 
temperature during the day but the land surface temperature can vary by many 
degrees during the diurnal cycle and this can be seen in a movie loop of these 
images.<BR><BR>

<A name=WV></A><B>Water Vapour Imagery</B><BR><BR>This image 
shows emitted radiation from the Earths atmosphere and cloud tops at a spatial 
resolution equivalent to 3km at the sub-satellite point but increases for higher 
latitudes and longitudes away from the meridian. They are available every 15 
minutes. White areas denote cold temperatures (cloud tops or moist areas of the 
upper troposphere) and dark areas denote warm temperatures (no high clouds and 
drier regions of the upper-mid troposphere). Radiation from this channel is 
averaged over a narrow spectral band centred at 6.2 microns. Most of the 
radiation originates from the upper atmospheric water vapour and cloud tops. 
Movie loops of these images can show areas of potential baroclinic development 
by showing dry (dark) intrusions appearing in association with areas of ascent 
(bright). They are also used as a proxy for potential vorticity of the upper 
atmosphere. <BR>&nbsp; <BR>

<A name=CTH></A><B>Cloud Top Height 
Product</B><BR><BR>This product shows the height of the cloud tops in feet, and 
is calculated using the infrared channels at wavelengths of 10.8, 12.0 and 13.4 
microns. Three possible algorithms are available for each pixel. In the first, 
the&nbsp; minimum residual method is employed to infer the cloud top height by 
using data from NWP model profiles to perform radiative transfer calculations, 
in order to simulate radiances in all three channels for different cloud top 
heights and effective cloud amounts. The method then attempts to find the 
solution which minimises the differences between the measured and simulated 
radiances in all three channels. A check is also made so as not to place the 
cloud top at the bottom of an unstable layer which would cause vigorous 
convection if subsequently assimilated into the NWP model. If an acceptable 
solution is found, i.e. if a well-defined minimisation is obtained, the value of 
cloud top height is accepted. This is typically the case for most mid- and 
high-level cloud. If a solution is not found, a single channel approach is used, 
the so-called stable layers method, which attempts to match the measured 
brightness temperature at 10.8 microns with the simulated value, reducing the 
weighting of any solution which would put the cloud top at the base of an 
unstable layer. The majority of low-level cloud is processed using this method. 
Finally, if an acceptable solution is still not found, a third method is used, 
which simply finds the best match between measured and simulated 10.8 microns 
brightness temperatures, working from the surface upwards, with no account taken 
of atmospheric stability.

<A name=CTT></A><B>Cloud Top Temperature Product</B><BR><BR>This product 
shows the temperature of the cloud tops in degC, and is calculated using the 
infrared channels at wavelengths of 10.8, 12.0 and 13.4 microns. Three possible 
algorithms are available for each pixel. In the first, the&nbsp; minimum 
residual method is employed to infer the cloud top height by using data from NWP

A check is also made so as not to place the cloud top at the bottom of an 
unstable layer which would cause vigorous convection if subsequently assimilated 
into the NWP model. If an acceptable solution is found, i.e. if a well-defined 
minimisation is obtained, the value of cloud top temperature corresponding to 
this height is accepted. This is typically the case for most mid- and high-level 
cloud. If a solution is not found, a single channel approach is used, the 
so-called stable layers method, which attempts to match the measured brightness 
temperature at 10.8 microns with the simulated value, reducing the weighting of 
any solution which would put the cloud top at the base of an unstable layer. The 
majority of low-level cloud is processed using this method. Finally, if an

<A name=ColouredFog></A><B>Coloured Fog Product (only available at 
night)</B><BR><BR>Fog and/or low cloud at night can be detected from the 
difference in emissivity of the fog/cloud tops and the underlying surface at 3.9 
and 11 microns wavelength. This product uses both measured and simulated 
radiances (the latter using an NWP profile) to determine if fog is present. The 
magnitude of the difference in radiance between the 2 channels and from the 
observed minus simulated radiances is a measure of the fog thickness. The fog 
top temperature can also be inferred from the infrared channel radiance. The 
intensity of the colour is a measure of the fog thickness and the colour 
indicates if the fog top is above freezing (red), around freezing (green) and 
below freezing (blue). Areas with no colour are free from fog or low cloud, and 
correspond to the 10.8 microns brightness temperature, which is used as a 
background for the coloured fog mask.

<A name=GreyscaleFog></A><B>Greyscale Fog Product (only available 
at night)</B><BR><BR>Fog and/or low cloud at night can be detected from the 
difference in emissivity of the fog/cloud tops and the underlying surface at 3.9 
and 11 microns wavelength. This product uses both measured and simulated 
radiances (the latter using an NWP profile) to determine if fog is present. The 
magnitude of the difference in radiance between the 2 channels and from the 
observed minus simulated radiances is a measure of the fog thickness. 
Differences larger than around 3.5 K, represented by the white end of the colour 
scale, correspond to fog or low cloud. Intermediate differences (in the 
2.5&nbsp; 3.5 K range) correspond to clear pixels, and differences smaller than 
around 2.5 K tend to correspond to mid- and upper-level cloud (and appear as 
black).<BR>&nbsp;<BR>


<A name=RGB></A><B>RGB 'False Colour' 321 Product (only available in the day)</B><BR><BR>RGB images are composite images 
generated by combining two or more channels and displaying in colour. The naming 
convention describes which channel is assigned to the red, green and blue 
colours. For example RGB 321 means that channel 3 (1.6 micron) is on the red, 
channel 2 (0.8 micron) is on the green and channel 1 (0.6 micron) is on the 
blue. 

This combination can then highlight different physical features through 
the differing amounts of red, green and blue and hence give a unique colour to 
that feature. In this case, turquoise clouds contain ice crystals, whilst white clouds are water 
clouds (inc. fog). Vegetation creates a green signal and sandy areas are pink. 
Snow covered ground is turquoise.
