<H1>Errata for Polar Pathfinder Sampler CD-ROM documentation for 1.25 km 
AVHRR product. </H1>

<P>
 In the documentation on the Polar Pathfinder Sampler CD-ROM for the 1.25 km AVHRR
products, an error has been found. Under Section D. (Data Processing and Product
Description), subsection 1. (Channel One through Five Radiances), there is a discussion of
the process to maximize higher-resolution coverage. Instead of relaxing the scan angle and
local-time-proximity requirements to 35 degrees and 1.5 hours, respectively, as stated in the
documentation on the Sampler CD-ROM, the scan angle and local-time-proximity
requirements were relaxed to 46 degrees (not 35) and 3 hours (not 1.5), respectively.
Similarly, in that same paragraph, instead of including data with scan angles as great as 35
degrees and with local time differences (from the composite's target local time) of as much as
1.5 hours, as stated in the documentation on the Sampler CD-ROM, where swaths are
missing, partial compensation for missing data is made by including data with scan angles as
great as 46 degrees (not 35) and with local time differences (from the composite's target local
time) of as much as 3 hours (not 1.5).
