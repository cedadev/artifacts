  <DT><STRONG>Level 0</STRONG>
  <DD>data are the basic telemetry data from the instruments after
  time-reversal and decommutation into specific sensor files. Level
  0 data have a common format.
  <DT><STRONG>Level 1</STRONG>
  <DD>data are the physical parameters actually measured by the
  sensors (e.g., atmospheric radiances in the case of the limb
  sounding instruments). Level 1 data have sensor-specific file
  formats.
  <DT><STRONG>Level 2</STRONG>
  <DD>data are the geophysical parameters calculated from Level
  1 data, such as atmospheric temperature profiles, gas concentrations,
  winds, or solar spectral irradiances. Atmospheric data at Level
  2 are related directly to the instrument measurement &quot;footprint&quot;,
  i.e., the character of the altitude scan is determined by a given
  instrument's scan rate, integration time, and viewing direction,
  as well as the spacecraft's orbital velocity. Level 2 data also
  have sensor-specific file formats.
  <DT><STRONG>Level 3A</STRONG>
  <DD>atmospheric data reflect the geophysical information of Level
  2 transformed into a common format and equally spaced along the
  measurement trajectory in time (&quot;Level 3AT&quot;, at 65.536
  second centers) or latitude (&quot;Level 3AL&quot;, every four
  degrees). Level 3A data have common file formats.
  <DT><STRONG>Level 3B</STRONG>
  <DD>atmospheric data consist of two daily latitude-longitude
  cross sections at approximately one-half scale height altitude
  intervals. (The two cross sections reflect segregation by north-going
  and south-going satellite data, which differ by 12 hours local
  time at the Equator.) These data are stored as 13 Fourier coefficients
  for each height around the latitude circles defined by Level
  3AL. Level 3B data also have a common file format.
