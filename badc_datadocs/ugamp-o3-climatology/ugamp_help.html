          Introduction </H3>
          <P>The UGAMP ozone climatology has been set up by Dingmin Li
          and Keith P. Shine at the Department of Meteorology of the University
          of Reading. It is a four-dimensional distribution of atmospheric
          ozone that has been built up from the <A HREF="#Combin">combination</A>
          of several <A HREF="#Descr">observational data sets</A>.
          <P>The climatology was originally conceived to replace the old
          ozone distributions used as an input in the UGAMP models, namely
          the built in ECMWF parameterization, hereafter called the <EM>internal
          climatology</EM>, and a two-dimensional climatology based on
          satellite data (<A HREF="#Thuburn">Thuburn, 1992</A>), hereafter
          called <EM>external climatology</EM>. The weakness of the ECMWF
          parameterization was an overestimation of the low polar stratosphere
          ozone content, leading in the UGAMP general circulation model
          (UGCM) to a biased calculated zonal mean dynamics in polar regions,
          while the 2-D climatology, although realistic, naturally missed
          the longitudinal variation. Moreover, the new climatology would
          ideally have to give account for the ozone interannual variability
          (e.g. the QBO signal). Therefore, a multi-year three-dimensional
          climatology was required, based on the most comprehensive observations
          available. The approach that has been adopted in this endeavour
          is summarized in the next sections. More details can be found
          in <A HREF="#LiShine">Li and Shine, 1995</A>.
          <P>The resulting climatology should be useful not only as a realistic
          prescribed ozone distribution for global circulation models,
          but also as a reference for validation of GCM that treat ozone
          as a prognostic variable.

          In space </H4>
          <P>The geographical coverage of the climatology is global, in
          spite of the existence of sparse observation areas in the original
          data sets, that have been the object of a particular treatment
          (<A HREF="#Tropos">troposphere</A> and <A HREF="#PolarN">polar
          night</A>). The climatology horizontal resolution is of 2.5 by
          2.5 degrees (144 points in longitude and 73 points in latitude
          from pole to pole). Its vertical coverage extends over <A HREF="levels.html">47
          levels</A> defined by isobaric surfaces, from the 0.0011 mb level
          down to the standard pressure level. The <A HREF="levels.html">vertical
          resolution</A> is irregular &#151; it is close to 2 km in the
          stratosphere.
          <P>These choices have been made according to the resolution adopted
          in the UGCM. However, a <A HREF="#Software">routine</A> is provided
          that converts the climatological data onto any other desired
          grid and/or vertical scale. <H4><A NAME="Time"></A>1.3.2 In time
          </H4>
          <P>The present state of the climatology includes five years (1985
          to 1989), with one 3-dimensional data set per month.

          <HR ALIGN=LEFT><H3>1.4 Description and comparison of the original
          data sets </H3>
          <P>At the time of its construction, the need of a multi-year
          climatology put a constraint on the possible data sets to be
          used. On the other hand, the latitude and height ranges of the
          designed climatology made it necessary to combine different sources
          of data, which would have to be homogenized in some way. As a
          result, the climatology is based mainly on satellite data from
          SBUV and SAGE II. Supporting data comes from ozone-sondes (Atmospheric
          Environment Service of Canada) and other satellite instruments,
          such as SME and TOMS. Data from the <A HREF="/data/uars/index.html">UARS</A>
          were not included, as they were not available at the time when
          the project began. <H4><A NAME="SBUV"></A>1.4.1 Solar Backscatter
          UltraViolet (SBUV) Instrument </H4>
          <P>SBUV (<A HREF="#Fleig">Fleig et al., 1990</A>; <A HREF="#WMO">WMO,
          1988</A>) measures the solar irradiance and the radiance backscattered
          by the Earth's atmosphere in 12 selected wavelength bands in
          the ultraviolet. From these radiances and irradiances, <A HREF="#DefCol">ozone
          columns</A> <sup>(1)</sup> and ozone profiles are obtained, using
          retrieval algorithms. SBUV views the nadir with a field of view
          of 200 x 200 kilometers. Every day, the observation covers 200
          km wide strips, 26&deg; apart in longitude. There are 13 or 14
          orbits per day. Data is available from November 1987 to June
          1990. The SBUV data used in the current climatology is version
          6. <H4><A NAME="SAGE"></A>1.4.2 Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas
          Experiment (SAGE) II </H4>
          <P><A HREF="/data/sage2/index.html">SAGE II</A> (<A HREF="#McCormick">McCormick,
          1992</A>; <A HREF="#Zawodny">Zawodny and McCormick, 1991</A>)
          is a seven-channel spectrometer covering selected wavelengths
          in the near UV, visible and near IR portion of the spectrum.
          The wavelengths were selected so that determination of aerosol
          extinction, ozone, nitrogen dioxide and water vapour profiles
          can be issued throughout the stratosphere and upper troposphere.
          SAGE II measures the Earth's limb extinction via the solar occultation
          technique during each spacecraft sunrise and sunset. This technique
          is inherently self-calibrating in that the instrument makes a
          direct measurement of the extraterrestrial solar irradiance before
          and after each sunrise and sunset occultation event. The 15 orbits
          per day yield 15 sunrise and 15 sunset profiles. The use of the
          sun as an irradiance source allows for a small instrument field
          of view and gives a very high vertical resolution. The data in
          a given day is uniformly spaced in longitude and closely spaced
          in latitude, which periodically ranges from 80&deg; South to
          80&deg; North. Data is available for October 1984 to early 1990.
          <H4><A NAME="Comp"></A>1.4.3 Comparison between SBUV and SAGE
          II </H4>
          <P>SBUV and SAGE II use very different spectral measurement techniques:
          nadir-viewing backscattered ultraviolet versus limb-viewing solar
          occultation. The vertical resolution of the two measurements
          is accordingly quite different. SBUV has an approximately 8-km
          resolution in the upper stratosphere but only 15-km resolution
          at and below the ozone maximum, whereas SAGE II gives a near
          1-km vertical resolution. By virtue of its limb-view self-calibration
          for every profile, SAGE II may, in principle, be regarded as
          a benchmark standard against which the coarse resolution SBUV
          profiles may be judged (<A HREF="#McPeters">McPeters et al.,
          1994</A>). The SAGE II data was used as the <EM>a priori</EM>
          climatology in the SBUV retrieval in the low to middle stratosphere
          layers, leading to retrieved SBUV profiles that follow the shape
          of the SAGE II profiles in this region though they do not necessarily
          agree with SAGE there. However, SAGE II measures ozone at a given
          latitude only once every month, providing very poor spatial and
          temporal coverage for the purpose of building a global climatology;
          whereas SBUV provides daily measurements on a global basis. SBUV
          has therefore been chosen as the main data set to establish the
          present climatology, at pressures between 1 and 70 mb, with SAGE
          II used as a supplement in the low stratosphere (at pressures
          higher than 70 mb) and in the mesosphere (at pressures lower
          than 1 mb). SAGE II is also used as a standard against which
          the quality of the climatology is checked. The comparison of
          profiles between SBUV and SAGE II by <A HREF="#McPeters">McPeters
          et al. (1994)</A> shows that both observations agree well in
          most stratospheric layers, with the exception of the high stratosphere
          (between 40 and 50 km) and low stratosphere. <H4><A NAME="SME"></A>1.4.4
          Solar Mesosphere Explorer (SME) </H4>
          <P>The ozone in SME data (<A HREF="#Rusch83">Rusch et al., 1983</A>;
          <A HREF="#Rusch84">1984</A>) is measured by both UV and near
          infrared airglow instruments; the latter gives ozone measurement
          from 50 to 90 km. Observation is made at the Earth's limb with
          an altitude resolution of about 4 km. Only the near infrared
          data has been used in the climatology as both the UV and near
          IR techniques provide similar results and as UV ozone data is
          available over a smaller vertical range. <H4><A NAME="TOMS"></A>1.4.5
          Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) and comparison with SBUV
          </H4>
          <P><A HREF="/data/toms/tomshelp.html#Nim7InstDes">TOMS</A> is
          an ozone-mapping instrument that was mounted next to the SBUV
          instrument on the Nimbus-7 satellite (<A HREF="#Heath">Heath
          et al., 1975</A>). It provided continuous measurements of <A
          HREF="#DefCol">total ozone</A> <sup>(1)</sup> on a longitude-latitude
          grid. Like SBUV, TOMS uses a nadir-view spectral measurement
          technique and works on the principle of backscattered ultraviolet
          radiation. However, whereas SBUV observes solar radiation backscattered
          only in the nadir, TOMS scans across the orbital track, sampling
          radiation backscattered from swaths that pass from side to side
          through the nadir. In principle, TOMS can obtain the signal due
          to the presence of ozone in both the stratosphere and the troposphere,
          but in practice it only measures the <A HREF="#DefCol">ozone
          column</A> <sup>(1)</sup> above the cloud top, with a correction
          from climatological ozone below the cloud during the retrieval.
          The uncertainty induced by this correction is found to be small
          (about 5 DU) in the monthly mean measurement (<A HREF="#Thompson">Thompson
          et al., 1993</A>). The accuracy of the TOMS data is considered
          very high in comparison to the ground based Dobson data (<A 
          HREF="#WMO">WMO, 1988</A>), with errors in the monthly mean measurements
          less than 1.5%. The <A HREF="/data/toms/tomshelp.html#Processing">TOMS
          data version 6</A> used in this climatology is from the BADC.
          It includes a correction of the long term drift (1978-1987) due
          to the degradation of the diffuser plate in the instrument (<A
          HREF="#Watson">Watson et al., 1988</A>). <H4><A NAME="AESC"></A>1.4.6
          Ozone-sondes from the Atmospheric Environment Service of Canada
          (AESC) </H4>
          <P>The ozone-sonde data acquired from the Atmospheric Environment
          Service of Canada (AESC) consists in a set of ozone profiles
          at each station of the network, at times when the observation
          was made. There is a total of 289 stations, some of which stopped
          operations long ago or have been in operation during a few years
          only, when not only a few months. These make the data discontinuous
          in both time and space. Three-dimensional ozone values could
          however be derived for the troposphere and part of the low stratosphere,
          based on the 2-dimensional (latitude-height) AESC ozone-sonde
          climatology carefully established by <A HREF="#London">London
          and Liu (1992)</A>, and using a <A HREF="#Tropos">technique</A>
          described in next section, that was developed for this purpose.

          of the climatology </H3><H4><A NAME="Interp"></A>1.5.1 Interpolation
          onto the adopted grid </H4>
          <P>As all data sets were supplied on different vertical grids
          and had different vertical resolutions, an accurate interpolation
          scheme had to be established in order to translate them onto
          the climatology grid whilst conserving the total ozone amount.
          As SAGE data have a high vertical resolution (of about 1 km),
          the error is negligible when these data are degraded to lower
          vertical resolution. However, for SBUV, which was chosen as the
          main data set for this climatology, the vertical resolution is
          poor, as mentioned in previous section. An interpolation scheme
          was therefore needed which must ensure the interpolated vertical
          profiles agree with the observed ones whatever the resolution
          of the latter. It was also required that the interpolated profiles
          should be smooth and agree with the observations both in terms
          of local mixing ratio and of <A HREF="#DefCol">ozone column</A>
          <sup>(1)</sup>. In this endeavour, SAGE II profiles were regarded
          as a benchmark standard and were used to investigate the interpolation
          scheme first. The SAGE II profiles were then degraded to the
          12 levels of SBUV and the scheme was tested again to check its
          meeting with the requirements listed above. After comparison
          of various methods, the cubic spline interpolation of the ozone
          column was found to be the best scheme (linear schemes, in particular,
          all gave unrealistic wiggles in the mixing ratio profiles). <H4><A
          NAME="Tropos"></A>1.5.2 Derivation of the tropospheric data </H4>As
          developed in <A HREF="#AESC">former section</A>, direct use of
          the ozone sondes proved difficult and unreliable. The strategy
          adopted to derive tropospheric ozone from the data was to use
          the 2-dimensional climatology based on the ozone sondes (<A 
          HREF="#London">London and Liu, 1992</A>) to provide the shape
          of the profile and use a combination of satellite data to define
          the tropospheric column (<A HREF="#Fishman">Fishman et al., 1990</A>).
          <P>Given the level of 100 mb as a boundary, the difference between
          TOMS <A HREF="#DefCol">total ozone column</A> <sup>(1)</sup>
          and the <A HREF="#DefCol">ozone column</A> <sup>(1)</sup> above
          the 100 mb level as determined from the <A HREF="#Combin">combination</A>
          of SME, SBUV and SAGE II provides a value for the remaining slab

          <P>Multiplying each ozone mixing ratio from the 2-D ozone sondes
          climatology by its associated &gamma;s provides a 3-dimensional
          tropospheric ozone field with profile shapes consistent with
          the ozone sondes and vertically integrated amounts consistent
          with TOMS. The adjustment performed in this way is generally
          small (0.8&lt;&gamma;&lt;1.8) and the transition of the derived
          ozone profiles from troposphere to low stratosphere is smooth.
          <H4><A NAME="PolarN"></A>1.5.3 Polar night interpolation scheme
          </H4>There were no data readily available for the polar night
          area. The <A HREF="/data/mls/index.html">Microwave Limb Sounder
          (MLS)</A> aboard <A HREF="/data/uars/index.html">UARS</A> has
          observations near the poles but was not in operation during the
          period of time covered by this climatology, and in any case its
          results were not available at the time when the climatology was
          initiated. A polar night interpolation scheme was therefore needed
          to fill the gaps shown by all the selected data sets in the polar
          night areas. Since changes with longitude are small within the
          mesosphere, it was decided to interpolate the zonal mean of the
          SME data from 0.24 mb upward. A simple cubic spline interpolation
          was thus applied to the 2-dimensional field of the zonally averaged
          ozone to extend the SME data into the polar night. In the case
          of all the other data sets, however, since they were not zonally
          symmetric, the simple cubic spline scheme could not be applied
          and a triangular polar interpolation scheme was designed for
          this purpose (see <A HREF="#LiShine">Li and Shine, 1995</A>,
          appendix). When applied to a month of data without polar gap
          (<EM>e.g.</EM> TOMS April Northern Hemisphere), from which the
          polar cap has been removed, this scheme gives back most features
          of the original data. <H4><A NAME="Combin"></A>1.5.4 Combination
          of the data sets </H4>Once interpolated on the required grid,
          the different data sets described in <A HREF="#Descr">section
          1.4</A> have been combined into a single climatology, each set
          corresponding to one or two specific vertical atmospheric regions,
          according to the above considerations. Table 1 below gives the
          boundaries of the vertical domains and the data sets used in
          each of these domains. Weighing functions are applied in the
          vicinity of the borders between two vertical regions, in order
          to ensure a smooth transition from one data set to the next one
          whilst retaining the trend of the profile. Examples of climatological
          profiles compared with the original data, as well as latitude-heoght
          cross-sections, are shown in <A HREF="#LiShine">Li and Shine,

          This was achieved using a simple 5-point horizontal smooth and
          a longitudinal 5-point running smooth. The field removed in this
          way is of a very small scale and the smoothed data keep the main

          of the data have taken place in the process of building the climatology,
          it was necessary to check the result against original observations.
          A number of profiles were thus extracted from the climatology
          and were compared to the corresponding SAGE II profiles, regarded
          as a benchmark standard data set, due in particular to its high
          vertical resolution (<A HREF="#McPeters">McPeters et al., 1994</A>).
          The comparison is generally very satisfactory, except near the
          equator, where the SAGE II ozone maximum is not fully reflected
          in the climatology (<A HREF="#LiShine">Li and Shine, 1995</A>).
          This is related to the fact that the main data set used is SBUV,
          which has a lower vertical resolution and is expected not to
          present such a sharp peak as SAGE II.
          <P>The climatological ozone zonal mean has also been compared
          with the existing UGAMP <EM>external climatology</EM>. The general
          features in both fields agree very well (see <A HREF="#LiShine">Li

          <P>In the case of perpetual January, the two ozone climatologies
          show significantly different values in the low stratosphere:
          the ECMWF parameterized ozone is larger than its climatological
          counterpart in both polar regions (by up to 3 ppmv in the summer
          hemisphere), shows an unrealistically pronounced vertical gradient
          in the tropical region and is lower at northern mid-latitudes.
          As a result, by comparison to Run 1, the low stratosphere in
          Run 2 is warmer by up to 10 K at summer high latitudes and cooler
          above the tropical tropopause and at Northern mid-latitudes.
          <P>The seasonal cycle experiment reveals strong discrepancies
          between Run 3 and Run 4 in terms of zonal mean temperature: the
          polar low stratosphere in Run 4 is warmer than in Run 3 by up
          to 10 K, in both summer and winter. Since the internal variability
          in the two runs is very similar both in distribution and in amplitude,
          the difference in the calculated temperature fields must be entirely
          attributed to the difference in the ozone amounts.
          <P>These experiments underline the sensitivity of the calculated
          temperature to the adopted ozone amount and emphasize the importance
          of choosing a realistic ozone climatology as an output to GCM.
