<P>To complement the BADC archives of ECMWF ERA-15 Re-analysis and Operational 
data, an archive of <I>derived</I> products has also been 
created, including monthly means and climatologies. This is held at
Manchester and is accessible<P>

The creator of the data was Paul Berrisford
of CGAM (Centre for Global Atmospheric Modelling) at the 
University of Reading. Queries about this data set should be 
directed to <A HREF="mailto:P.Berrisford@reading.ac.uk">
P.Berrisford@reading.ac.uk</A>.

<P>There are a variety of data products available, mainly averages
but also some gridded products. The averaging period types are: 

<UL>
  <LI>Monthly mean (for a given month and year)
  <LI>Seasonal mean (the mean of three consecutive months)
  <LI>Monthly climatology (ie. a long-period average for 1979-93)
  <LI>Seasonal climatology (ie. a long-period average for 1979-93)
</UL>

<P>The data types available: 

<UL>
  <LI>Forecast surface fields
  <LI>Non-forecast surface fields
  <LI>Computed surface fields (e.g. column heating)
  <LI>Tropopause fields (e.g. theta on Potential Vorticity (PV)=3.5 pvu)
  <LI>Pressure level fields
  <LI>Pressure level transient fields
  <LI>Isentropic level fields
  <LI>Isentropic level transient fields
</UL>

<P>A set of web pages is maintained to give help and information
about this <A HREF="http://www.met.rdg.ac.uk/Data/era/era.html" TARGET="_top">dataset</A>.

Restricted data</H2>

<P>These data are for bona fide research purposes only and access
is therefore restricted. <EM>Note that the ECMWF data is only
available via the meteorological organisation in your own country.
The BADC distributes <A HREF="/data/ecmwf-era/non-uk.html">in
the UK</A> for the UK Meteorological Office.</EM> For this reason,
we do not make the data available to anonymous users through these
WWW pages.<BR>

In order to gain access to the data, please <A HREF="/cgi-bin/dataset_registration/dataset_info.cgi.pl?datasetid=ecmwf_means">appy for access to the ECMWF derived data products</a>.
The application includes the Met Office Agreement to be signed and returned to BADC. You will then
be given access to the data from an account on one of the BADC's
computers.
