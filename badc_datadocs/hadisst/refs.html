<u>Abstract</u>:
<p>
We present the Met Office Hadley Centre's sea ice and sea surface temperature (SST) data set, 
HadISST1, and the nighttime marine air temperature (NMAT) data set, HadMAT1. HadISST1 replaces 
the global sea ice and sea surface temperature (GISST) data sets and is a unique combination of 
monthly globally complete fields of SST and sea ice concentration on a 1° latitude-longitude grid 
from 1871. The companion HadMAT1 runs monthly from 1856 on a 5° latitude-longitude grid and 
incorporates new corrections for the effect on NMAT of increasing deck (and hence measurement) 
heights. HadISST1 and HadMAT1 temperatures are reconstructed using a two-stage reduced-space optimal 
interpolation procedure, followed by superposition of quality-improved gridded observations onto 
the reconstructions to restore local detail. The sea ice fields are made more homogeneous by 
compensating satellite microwave-based sea ice concentrations for the impact of surface melt 
effects on retrievals in the Arctic and for algorithm deficiencies in the Antarctic and by 
making the historical in situ concentrations consistent with the satellite data. SSTs near sea 
ice are estimated using statistical relationships between SST and sea ice concentration. HadISST1 
compares well with other published analyses, capturing trends in global, hemispheric, and regional 
SST well, containing SST fields with more uniform variance through time and better month-to-month 
persistence than those in GISST. HadMAT1 is more consistent with SST and with collocated land 
surface air temperatures than previous NMAT data sets.
