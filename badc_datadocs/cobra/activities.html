<li><a name="A1"></a><h3>(A1) To perform initial laboratory testing and validation for new instruments/techniques to be used
within COBRA. Lead:  Professor John Plane, University of East Anglia. </h3>
<p>One of the unique aspects of COBRA is that it will bring together a very wide range of instruments for
both in-situ measurements and fluxes of halogens and other trace gases and particles. Some of this
instrumentation is newly developed and/or will be developed within the timeframe of COBRA (yet
largely funded from elsewhere), namely cavity-enhanced DOAS for in-situ and sensitive measurements
of halogen radicals and I2 and a denuder-based ICP-MS technique for in-situ
measurements of I2.
<p>Cavity-enhanced differential optical absorption spectroscopy (CE-DOAS) is a variant of the very wellestablished
long-path DOAS (LP-DOAS) technique. CE-DOAS, recently demonstrated by A. Ruth and
colleagues (<a href="references.html">Fiedler et al. 2003</a>), uses a short-arc broad-band Xe lamp source which is fed into an
optically stable cavity between two highly-reflecting spherical mirrors (similar to a cavity ring down
experiment); light that emerges from the cavity is then spectrally dispersed using a conventional
spectrometer with a CCD detector. We will collaborate closely with Dr Ruth (University College Cork,
Ireland) to develop this technique into a field instrument for measuring BrO (315-360 nm), IO (413-453 nm),
 OIO and I2 (535 - 575 nm). Anticipated detection limits are a factor of ~ 5 worse than our LPDOAS
(e.g. [BrO] > 4 ppt), but this should be acceptable for measuring the high levels of halogen oxides
in polar springtime. For atmospheric measurements, we will determine the effective path length of the
cavity by reference to the H2O overtone bands at 445 and 571 nm using a hygrometer to measure the
atmospheric humidity, and independently measured O3 in the Huggins bands for the 330 nm region.
<P>The CE-DOAS technique is being developed as part of other current projects. An
additional in-situ technique for determination of molecular iodine will be developed specifically for
COBRA, based on the methodology of <a href="references.html">Hoffman et al. (2005)</a>, using multiple denuder banks analysed by
ICP/MS. This will allow collection of semi-continuous measurements of I2 over several diurnal periods.
We estimate it will take 1 year after the start date of COBRA to build and test field versions of these
systems before deployment (the development of the CE-DOAS is starting in October 2005).

<p><li><a name="A2"></a><h3>(A2) To produce a large high quality data set on the composition, properties and fluxes of gases and
aerosols within a "bromine hot spot" of the Arctic boundary layer. Lead: Dr Lucy Carpenter and Dr Alistair Lewis, University of York.</h3>
<p>To date there are, to our knowledge, no published reports of co-measured BrO, IO, Hg and O3 in the
Arctic. COBRA will be the most comprehensively instrumented Polar halogen atmospheric chemistry
campaign to date, and be used to generate a detailed inventory of halogen compounds in Arctic air, using
for the first time a combination of cavity-enhanced (in-situ) DOAS, active long-path DOAS, MAXDOAS,
off-line ICP-MS, on-line GC-MS, and on-line APCI-MS, in conjunction with a wide range of
supporting data including mercury speciated in the gas, particle and snow phase, particle measurements
including iodine enhancement in the ultrafine mode, and ancillary trace gas measurements.
The 7 week long field experiment during spring at Kuujjuarapik will collect data on an extensive range
of halogen species (I2/IO/BrO/OIO, Br2/BrCl, organohalogens including CH2I2, CH2IBr, CH2ICl,
CH2Br2, CHBr2Cl, CHBr3), volatile organic compounds (non- methane hydrocarbons, C2-C5 carbonyl
compounds), DMS and inorganic species (O3, Hg, NO, NO2, CO) in the gas phase, and photolysis
frequencies, focused on measuring the key parameters needed to constrain or validate the developed
models. Non-methane hydrocarbons will be used as tracers for active Br and Cl chemistry, e.g. by
analysing for selective removal of acetylene compared to benzene, allowing comparison of in-situ
measured reactive halogens and integrated, calculated Br and Cl concentrations. Boundary layer
meteorology in the field will be characterised via tethered balloon and kite systems, giving boundary
layer height up to about 350 m, and ozone concentrations to 250 m.
<p>The Kuujjuarapik campaign will also produce data on aerosol composition and properties. Particle
number concentrations greater than 3 nm and 10 nm will be measured using two counters, also providing
a measure of the ultra-fine particle population continuously (1 Hz). Particle size distributions between 3
and 3000 nm diameter will be made using a Differential Mobility Particle Sizer (DMPS) and optical
particle counters (OPC). Impactor measurements and off-line analysis using TEM/ESEM and EDX will
provide atomic composition and the mixing state of iodine in bulk particles.
<p>Flux measurements to be made on the sea-ice during the Kuujjuarapik campaign are described in detail in A4. Following each campaign/study, data will be validated by individual
groups, and recorded in common NASA Ames format. Co-I Evans will act as data manager to oversee
this activity, and to co-ordinate the submission of data to the BADC. Data would be made publicly
available two years from date of submission.

<p><li><a name="A3"></a><h3>(A3) To characterise the physical and chemical nature of sea-ice/snowpack surfaces, frost-flowers, and
the biological nature of any under-ice diatoms. Lead: Dr Howard Roscoe, British Antarctic Survey.</h3>
<p>Knowledge of the precise nature of the sea ice/snowpack/frost flower surfaces will be key to interpreting
the field trace gas measurements and understanding (and thereby providing parameterizations of) the link
between the halogen source and atmospheric concentrations. Surfaces will be characterized according to
several variables. Samples will be collected in the field: both the immediate surface (such as frost
flowers or upper snowpack) and the underlying ones (such as brine under frost flowers) will be collected
separately at regular intervals during the measurement cycle. Part of each sample will be returned to the
UK for off-line analysis of major ions using an ion chromatograph. Existing capability includes sodium,
chloride, nitrate, sulphate, bromide. Iodide will be quantified by an external laboratory under contract.
In addition, we will measure the pH of the various surfaces, given the pH-dependence of a number of the
relevant reactions.
<p>The specific surface area of different surfaces will be measured using the BET isotherm method
previously used successfully on snow. If we are successful in a parallel bid, then we will have our own
SSA equipment funded already, which will be made under contract by local suppliers following the
method specified in <a href="references.html">Legagneux et al. (2002)</a>. In case the parallel bid fails, we will instead collect
samples in the field and transport them under liquid nitrogen (using cryogenic travel-approved shipping
Dewars) to Europe, where F. Domine is willing to work with us to analyse a reduced number of samples
using his apparatus.
<p>Samples of under-ice diatoms will be collected by scraping the underside of the sea ice with simple tools,
both through holes drilled in the ice and at the edge of open water leads. At least 40 samples will be
collected, and bagged via a simple protocol involving dark cold storage, for microscope examination and
analysis back at BAS Cambridge. Drill, tools and operator training will be provided. The analysis will
result in a comprehensive statement of numbers of each species of diatom in each sample, in order to
relate to the potential for production of iodine compounds from literature values.

<p><li><a name="A4"></a><h3>(A4) To determine the relative and/or combined roles of sea-ice, frost flowers, sea-salt enriched snow
pack and biological sources in the exchange of halogens, ozone and particles in the field. Lead:
Dr Martin Gallagher, University of Manchester and Dr Lucy Carpenter, University of York</h3>
<p>In activity 4, we aim to determine what type of surfaces are the most effective halogen atom producers;
first year sea-ice on which frost flowers exist, open leads from which ice algal emissions can ventilate,
surface diatoms on sea-ice, or ventilated snowpack enriched in surface deposited sea-salt? This wideranging
activity can be broken down to smaller sub-objectives, i.e. to:
<ul>
<li> determine the dominant surface/s for iodine release, as previously observed at Kuujjuarapik and
Halley
<li> investigate the nature and magnitude of frost flower halogen emissions, per area, as a function of
their age, the air/sea-ice differential temperature, atmospheric boundary layer parameters and
illumination
<li> investigate the nature and magnitude of biological halogen emissions from open leads (under-ice
algae) and from surface ice (surface diatoms)
<li> study the effect of DOM content, pH, carbonate and deposited sulfate and/or nitrate aerosol on
halogen release from sea-ice and snowpack in the field - i.e. what is the effect of deposited sulfate
or nitrate aerosol?
</ul>
<p>A combination of tried and tested micrometeorological measurement techniques, described below, at
small ice-camps on the sea-ice will be used to assess the relative roles of different surfaces (characterised
as described in activity A3), with different ionic compositions, in halogen, ozone and particle exchange.
We will analyse I2 and halocarbons using off-line adsorbent tube/mass spectrometry methodologies,
simply requiring pumps and an automated tube sampler. Measurements of Br2, BrCl (by APCI mass
spectrometry- see <a href="references.html">Spicer et al. (2002)</a>), O3, and particles will be made in situ, requiring an "Arctic
proofed" enclosure mounted on sleds i.e. a movable ice camp, and powered from a generator located
near the field station (using 3-phase extension cables of up to 1 km and a distribution box mounted on
one of the sleds). Because the ice-camps will be within 1 km of the shore, the instrumentation/sleds can
be pulled by skidoo back to the shore and stored in a shipping container when not in use, reducing any
potential damage. The surfaces studied will include artificial leads created in low wind and low
temperature (<- 20C) conditions by digging small holes (~ 1 m x 1 m) into the young sea ice within the
first 2 weeks of the Kuujjuarapik campaign (mid February to early March), when temperatures are
sufficiently low. Almost any newly-frozen lead under low wind and low temperature conditions will
grow frost flowers (e.g. <a href="references.html">Martin et al., 1996</a> and references therein). Depending on the temperature, the
frost flowers have different crystal natures and growth habits; laboratory studies show that at
temperatures of about -20C, structures form after ~ 2.5 days (<a href="references.html">Martin et al., 1996</a>). In the field,
colleagues at DAMPT, Cambridge (Grae Worster, pers. comm., 2005) have found it straightforward to
create leads at Spitzbergen and we aim to follow their approach. As these leads evolve from open water
to frozen sea-ice, we will characterise both ice algae emissions from the open lead, and later frost flower
emissions as a function of age. The Kuujjuarapik station director, Claude Tremblay, along with locally
employed Inuit people will be responsible for the creation of the leads and will provide safety measures
on the sea-ice.
<p>Dynamic flux chambers will be deployed simultaneously over (i) open leads (to investigate frost flower
sources), and (ii) snow pack surfaces. We will measure I2, Br2, BrCl, halocarbons, O3, and sizesegregated
and ultrafine particles in the chambers. We estimate a total power consumption of 7 kW for
these experiments. We will construct a ~ 1 m x 1 m chamber, coated with Mylar, with a minimum
volume of ~ 80 L to fit over the leads. The chamber will be stirred to avoid vertical concentration
gradients. In each case multiple air samples will be collected from the chambers over relatively short
periods before re-exposing the underlying surfaces to the atmosphere. The procedure of alternate
measurement and re-exposure will be repeated over a period of several days and at different locations to;
minimise microclimate induced changes that will occur within the chambers and so influence possible
emission processes; and to account for spatial heterogeneity in the sources. Chambers that are opaque or
transparent to UV radiation will be deployed simultaneously to simulate arctic day-night changes in
emission sources. Temperature, pH and light levels will be measured within the chambers.
The flux gradient technique (using the same sample and analytical techniques as used in the chambers)
will be used to (i) confirm open leads as sources (using continuous concentration profile measurements
upwind and downwind of the lead), and (ii) to measure emissions from snowpack sources whose source
fetch is unaffected by leads. The efficacy and quality of the flux gradient measurements to be used in the
final analysis to assign source footprints and strengths will be controlled by measurements made using
turbulence and sensible heat flux measurements with sonic anemometers.
<p>The eddy correlation technique in conjunction with a fast response chemiluminescence ozone analyser
will be used to determine fluxes of ozone deposition to snowpack and fetches influenced by open leads.
Finally, the role of sea salt aerosol in air in liberating halogens will be investigated using models
constrained by measured halogen oxide concentrations and size-resolved aerosol distributions. The
model of <a href="references.html">McFiggans et al. (2000, 2002)</a>, extended to include full bromine chemistry and treatment of
aerosol microphysics and aqueous chemistry will be initialised by measured gas phase concentrations
and aerosol distribution measurements and driven by halogen precursor fluxes and measured radiometry
to predict the concentrations of reactive halogen species (RHS). Whilst source heterogeneity may not
allow direct comparison with measured RHS, a predicted climatology of RHS based on a range of
emission scenarios may be constructed and used to estimate the impact on ozone concentrations and HOx
species.
<p><li><a name="A5"></a><h3>(A5) To conduct laboratory studies with frost flower surrogates and to examine the effect of
temperature, pH, and other surface constituents on the exchange of trace gases. Lead: Dr Manuel Hutterli, British Antarctic Survey.</h3>
<p>The goal of the laboratory experiments is to separate and adequately quantify the impact of relevant
physical and chemical processes driving the exchange of trace gases and kinetics. These experiments
constitute an interface between the field measurements and the models, and are designed to improve both
the interpretation of the field data and model parameterizations.
The experiments build on previous experience in growing artificial frost flowers [<a href="references.html">Martin et al., 1996</a>],
and in investigating O3 loss over frozen salt solutions in the presence and absence of UV-radiation
[<a href="references.html">Hutterli et al., 2005; Oum et al., 1998; Rankin, 2004</a>]. Recent results suggest a significant O3 loss over
frozen NaBr and NaI solutions in the dark and the production of compounds that photolyse to destroy O3.
The O3 losses increased in the presence of frost flowers.
<p>A new, closed environmental chamber will be built to accommodate the connection of a subset of the
gas-phase and aerosol monitoring instruments used in the field campaigns (iodine/bromine halocarbons,
I2, IO, O3, NOx, total condensation particle counts with 3nm cut-off). Vertical temperature gradients in
the chamber across the salt water and air in the headspace as well as relative humidity in the latter will be
controllable over a large range covering typical values encountered in the Arctic and will allow growing
various types and amounts of frost flowers. The composition of the inflowing air and the salt solution
can be varied, and the chamber irradiated with UV. In addition to measuring the processed air, the
concentration of major ions and the pH of the produced ice, brine and frost flowers will be measured.
The specific surface area of the frost flowers will be determined and the evolution of the frost flowers
recorded with a digital camera.
<p>Experimental set-up will commence during autumn 2007, with initial lab experiments in late 2007. More
specific experiments, based on the field work, will be conducted throughout 2008.

<p><li><a name="A6"></a><h3><li>(A6) To investigate the impact of iodine chemistry and sea-ice/snowpack/atmosphere exchange on ozone
and mercury depletion. Lead: Dr Matthew Evans, University of Leeds.</h3>
<p>Here we will extend the work of Co-I <a href="references.html">Evans (2003)</a> to include iodine and Hg chemistry and to
describe the flux of material between the snow / ice / ocean surface and the boundary layer in a 1D
framework. The parameterization of fluxes between the surface and the atmosphere will be based on
the observations made in the other Activities, and will be used to investigate the linked flux of
halogens, ozone and other species into or out from the surface. The methodology here will follow that
of our previous work which used chemical coordinates (typically the O3 concentration but in this case
the Hg concentration may prove useful) rather than temporal or spatial coordinates. This helps to
remove many of the problems of interpreting observations collected at a fixed site and allows the
emphasis of model / measurement failure to be towards the chemical / physical rather than dynamical
processes.
<p>The scientific goals are to:
<ul><li> Identify the direct and indirect impact of iodine chemistry on O3 and Hg loss
<li> Study the processes (typically the reactions between halogen atoms and VOCs and oVOCs) that
limit the ozone and mercury depletion potentials of the different halogens through the
termination of catalytic cycles.
<li> Determine the form/s of Hg that are deposited to the surface.
<li> Investigate the processes that control the flux of material in and out of the snow pack / ice /
ocean. What limits these fluxes and how should they be parameterised in CTMs?
<li> Contribute to current knowledge of how anthropogenic changes have impacted the photochemistry
of halogen chemistry in the Arctic. The focus here will be on acidification due to human sulfur
emissions, radiation due to stratospheric ozone loss and oxidants levels due to changing precursor
emissions. This study will investigate the sensitivity of the chemistry to these parameters and
hence investigate whether the increase in BrO observed from satellite is entirely due to increased
break-up of sea ice or whether there are other processes which are playing a part.
</ul>
<p>
<p><li><a name="A7"></a><h3><li>(A7) To quantify the role (if any) of iodine emissions on new particle formation in the Arctic. Lead:
Dr Gordon McFiggans and Dr Hugh Coe, University of Manchester.</h3>
<p>A quantitative relationship between atomic iodine precursor strength and new particle nucleation and
growth (<a href="references.html">Saiz-Lopez et al., 2005</a>) has recently been reported in the coastal environment. There is no
reason to suspect that such a physical relationship is not universal; therefore particle formation will be
favoured wherever there is sufficient iodine atom flux and available ozone. Competition for the iodine-
(and bromine-) containing species will be provided by condensation to available pre-existing aerosol
particles. This measurement- and modelling-based activity seeks to investigate the condensed-phase fate
of reactive halogen species (RHS) with particular emphasis on new particle formation.
<p>There are a number of questions which will be addressed by this activity, including:
<ul><li>Does the iodine in the aerosol preferentially reside in one size range, and how does this vary
with airmass (hence RHS source type)?
<li>Do we see significant new aerosol production - what is the scale of the phenomenon?
<li>Can we see a signal in the background size distribution - and would we expect to? If so, how
does this vary by airmass (hence RHS source type)?
<li>Do we need to repopulate the distribution from the small sizes or are there sufficient
"conventional" sources to explain observations? Does the nucleation mode contribute
significantly to the background population?
<li>How important is this potential new source of particles on a local, regional and global scale?
Do the nucleation mode particles grow sufficiently to significantly contribute to the CCN (or
ice nuclei) population?
</ul>
<p>To address these, a range of instrumentation will be deployed to characterise the aerosol population as a
function of wind sector (hence source region). These will include a differential mobility particle sizer
(DMPS) system, condensation particle counters, an optical particle spectrometer and an impactor system
loaded with TEM grids
<p>A model of iodine cluster nucleation and growth, similar to that used in <a href="references.html">Saiz-Lopez et al (2005)</a> will be
coupled to the model of halogen cycling used in (A4) to investigate the impact of the iodine on aerosol
composition and distribution. Fluxes derived in A4 will be used to drive the model and thus the potential
for iodine species emitted from the sea, snow or ice surface to contribute to aerosol processes will be
investigated, comparing model output with measured aerosol physical properties.
