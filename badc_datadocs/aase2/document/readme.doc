README.DOC  (1992-08-03 - pgh)

1.  Introduction

    This CD-ROM contains the final data pertaining to the Airborne Arctic
    Stratospheric Expedition II (AASE II) which was based in Bangor, Maine 
    between October 1991 and March 1992, with ER-2 flights from Ames Research
    Center, Fairbanks (Alaska), and Bangor; and DC-8 flights from Ames, Bangor,
    Anchorage (Alaska), Stavanger (Norway), and Tahiti.
 
    The data consist of measurements collected onboard the NASA ER-2 and DC-8 
    aircraft, ozonesonde soundings from six Canadian stations, global grid
    point values of Nimbus 7 TOMS ozone, and selected radiosonde soundings
    from stations in the region of the experiment.
 
    Theory teams provided calculations of potential vorticity, temperature,
    geopotential, horizontal winds, parcel back trajectories, and 
    concentrations of short lived species along the aircraft flight tracks; 
    and northern hemispheric analyses of potential vorticity, temperature,
    geopotential, horizontal winds, and radiative heating rates.
 
    All files within this release are standard ASCII files with variable length 
    records terminated by a carriage return/line feed pair (<CR><LF>, ASCII 
    decimal values 13 and 10).  Therefore, MS-DOS users should be able to read 
    them as they are, but UNIX and Mac users will have to strip off either the
    <CR> or the <LF> from each line to convert them to standard UNIX or Mac 
    files.  Commercially available software, such as dos2unix and Apple File
    Exchange, exists to convert MS-DOS files to both UNIX and Mac files.  
    VMS users can define the files to have STREAM record formats.
 
    In general, the file naming convention uses a two-character prefix to 
    identify the measurement, followed by a six digit number (yymmdd) giving 
    the year, month, and day (UT) of the flight, balloon launch, or model
    result.  To identify the measurement platform, a three character extension
    of EA1, DA1, Bhh, or Ghh is used to denote the data is from the ER-2,
    DC-8, balloon, or grid point model output (hh denotes the UT hour of
    balloon launch or model result).  Exceptions to this convention are the
    SFyymmdd.Enn files which use the extensions E00, E01, E05, E30 to denote
    aerosol loading factors; the TOMS data files which have the extensions 
    N7; and the chemical modelling result MA911006.H00.


2.  Major changes from the preliminary AASE II CD-ROM

    Many investigators submitted new and/or revised datasets for this edition.
    The files DC8TABLE.DOC and ER2TABLE.DOC list the data files available for
    each flight and indicate whether they are original (from the preliminary 
    AASE II CD-ROM), revised, or new.  The variable RDATE on line seven of 
    the file header specifies the revision date for the file.  Additionally,
    the special comment lines, also in the file header, may provide
    information on the revision history of the file.
   
    2.1  New Files - DC-8

         2.1.1  NO - measurements of NO from the NCAR in-situ NO detectors
       
         2.1.2  N2 - measurements of NO2 from the NCAR in-situ NO detectors
       
         2.1.3  TS - optical depth calculations from the Ames Sun photometer

    2.2  New Files - ER-2

         2.2.1  BR - measurements of BrO from the Harvard ClO/BrO instrument

    2.3  New Files - Documentation

         The format specification files, FORSPEC1.PS and FORSPEC2.PS,
         have been upgraded to Level 2 PostScript.

    2.4  Corrections

         Some Resolute ozonesonde files were incorrectly named and archived
         as radiosondes on the preliminary AASE II CD-ROM.  A complete set
         of revised Resolute ozonesonde files have been properly named (RL
         instead of RS) and now reside in the O3SONDE subdirectory (and 
         have been removed from the RAOB subdirectory).
       

3.  Directories

    3.1  The DOCUMENT directory contains several files documenting the 
         contents of this edition.

         Files:

         3.1.1  CONTACT.DOC contains an updated list of names, addresses, and
                phone numbers of the principal investigators responsible for
                generating the datasets in this release.

         3.1.2  DC8TABLE.DOC contains a record of the available DC-8 datasets
                in tabular format.  Please see the file header for help in 
                discerning new/revised datasets versus those that are unchanged
                from the first edition.
  
         3.1.3  ER2TABLE.DOC contains a record of the available ER-2 datasets
                in tabular format.  Please see the file header for help in
                discerning new/revised datasets versus those that are unchanged
                from the first edition.

         3.1.4  FORSPEC1.PS and FORSPEC2.PS are PostScript files of the
                document entitled "Format Specification for Data Exchange"
                which defines the standard file formats in which all data are
                recorded.  These two PostScript files can be printed on any 
                printer that understands PostScript.  FORSPEC1.PS contains the
                title page and table of contents; FORSPEC2.PS contains the
                bulk of the document.

    3.2  The DATA directory has six subdirectories for the DC-8, ER-2, model
         results, ozonesonde soundings, radiosonde soundings, and TOMS data 
         files.

         Subdirectories:

         3.2.1  DC8 contains the available data collected onboard the DC-8 
                aircraft, and calculations of potential vorticity, 
                temperature, geopotential, and horizontal wind along the 
                aircraft flight track.  Each file contains data for one 
                flight which begins on the UT date indicated by the file name.

         3.2.2  ER2 contains the available data collected onboard the ER-2
                aircraft, calculations of potential vorticity, temperature, 
                geopotential, horizontal wind, parcel back trajectories, 
                and concentrations of short lived species along the aircraft 
                flight track.  Each file contains data for one flight which 
                begins on the UT date indicated by the file name.

         3.2.3  MODEL contains 12 Z hemispheric analyses of potential 
                vorticity, temperature, horizontal winds, and radiative 
                heating rates; and one file named MA911006.H00 which 
                contains gas-phase chemistry model reconstructions of several 
                radicals as a function of latitude, altitude, and local time.

         3.2.4  O3SONDE contains ozonesonde soundings from the six Canadian 
                launch sites: Alert, Churchill, Goose Bay, Iqaluit, Resolute, 
                and Stony Plain.  Each file contains one sounding.

         3.2.5  RAOB contains selected radiosonde soundings near the aircraft 
                flight tracks.  Each file contains several soundings for a 
                particular time period.

         3.2.6  TOMS contains files of global grid point values of total 
                ozone data from the Nimbus 7 Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer
                (TOMS) with one file per day.
