<p>A brief description of the experiment IDs that make up the UJCC Dataset Matrix</p>
<br>
<b>eacsd</b><a name="anchor_eacsd"</a>
   <p>
   Present-day (pre-release) HadGEM1a run from 1/9/78.<br>
   Equivalent to eacsc, but with the stricter convergence tolerance in the GCR
   solver for the atmospheric dynamics:<br>
   eacsc: Absolute tolerance=1e-2<br>
   eacsd: Absolute tolerance=1e-3<br>
   </p>
   <br>
<b>eacye</b><a name="anchor_eacye"</a>
   <p>
   Present-day (pre-release) HadGEM1a run from 1/9/78 to 1/12/08.<br>
   Equivalent to eacsb/c, but with bit-level perturbations added to the initial
   atmosphere dump to explore model sensitivity to initial conditions.
   </p>
   <br>
<b>eadvi eadvj eadvl</b><a name="anchor_eadv*"</a>
   <p>
   These runs together make up a  50-year n144 atmosphere 1deg ocean run.
   </p>
   <br>
<b>eadwh</b><a name="anchor_eadwh"</a>
   <p>
   Present-day (pre-release) HiGEM1a run from 1/9/78 to its failure on 26/9/93.<br>
   The run was restarted from 1/9/93 as job eafeb, which includes mods to get
   around the problem that caused the failure.
   </p>
   <br>
<b>eadze</b><a name="anchor_eadze"</a>
   <p>
   Present-day (pre-release) HadGEM1a run from 1/9/78 to 01/12/88<br>
   Equivalent to eacsc, but starting from ECMWF atmospheric analysis.
   </p>
   <br>
<b>eaepc eaepd eaeva</b><a name="anchor_eae*"</a>  
   <p>
   5 year n144 atmosphere-only runs (with SSTs from HiGEM).<br> 
   These experiments are aimed at checking the influence of Tropical Instability Waves on the atmosphere. 
   </p>
   <br>
<b>eafeb</b><a name="anchor_eafeb"</a>
   <p>
   Present-day (pre-release) HiGEM1a run started from eadwh; 1/9/93 onwards.<br>
   For the first 3 months (i.e. to 1/12/93) the model setup was the same as eadwh
   except that polar filtering of increments was turned off. Following this, a
   mod (moses2_snow_vn1.mf77) was also introduced in order to get around problems
   related to the melting of ice pillars in the Himalayan region.<br>
   The job archive, eafeb_job.tar.gz, is for this second version.
