    <p>Present-day (pre-release) HiGEM1a run from 1/9/78 to its failure on 26/9/93.
       The run was restarted from 1/9/93 as job eafeb, which includes mods to get
       around the problem that caused the failure.

    <p>Present-day (pre-release) HiGEM1a run started from eadwh; 1/9/93 onwards.
       For the first 3 months (i.e. to 1/12/93) the model setup was the same as eadwh
       except that polar filtering of increments was turned off. Following this, a
       mod (moses2_snow_vn1.mf77) was also introduced in order to get around problems
       related to the melting of ice pillars in the Himalayan region.
