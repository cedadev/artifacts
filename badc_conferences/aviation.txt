Aviation Impacts on the Atmosphere

 

This town meeting at Birkbeck College in London, sponsored by
the NERC Centres for Atmospheric Science, aims to identify the 
key research required to improve our understanding of atmospheric 
processes so as to better evaluate the impacts of aviation on the 
atmosphere. Scientific questions relating to climate change and air 
quality will be discussed. The meeting will consist of research talks 
and discussion sessions and will be of interest to both atmospheric 
scientists and aeronautical engineers. The aim of the meeting is to 
promote research collaboration but also there will be a published 
report, prepared by the organisers that will be used to make the 
case for additional Research Council and other funding, and provide 
input to technology-based assessments such as "Greener by Design". 


The meeting will be held from 1pm 11 November to 1pm 
12 November 2004. Those interested in attending should register by 
sending an email to Linda Tse at l.tse@rdg.ac.uk.  As space is 
limited we suggest registering as soon as possible, but in any case 
by 11 October. You should indicate if you want to give a talk and 
if so on which topic. Note however, that there can only be a small, 
but representative, set of presentations. Hotel accommodation is 
available at the Travel Inn Putney Bridge for those requiring it ? 
information will be provided following registration. The organisers 
of the meeting are: David Lee (d.s.lee@mmu.ac.uk), 
Helen Rogers (helen.rogers@atm.ch.cam.ac.uk) and 
Alan Thorpe (a.j.thorpe@rdg.ac.uk).
