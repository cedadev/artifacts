UK Space Conference - 16th October at the Royal Society

Science and applications of the space environment:
new results and interdisciplinary connections

Discussion meeting at Royal Society, 16-18 October 2001
First announcement: Abstract deadline 15 September 2001

The 'space environment' is a multidisciplinary topic in science,
applications and engineering, covering exciting areas of high current
interest including observing the Earth and planets, the sun-Earth
connection, Earth's environment in space, hazard warning and forecasting
and the underlying space and spacecraft technologies. There are natural
connections between these areas in terms of the scientific techniques
and the space technology required. Some of the connections are only now
being discovered and exploited, and this discussion meeting will provide
a timely focus for pursuing these further and identifying others.

The main goals of the meeting are to
· Identify links between different areas of science and technology
· Identify gaps in science, interpretation and applications
· Identify underlying technology

The meeting format will consist of 40 minutes talks by invited speakers
(including discussion) for key topics, with poster presentation sessions
(including short plenary presentations) and panel discussions to
encourage wide participation.

The main topics of the meeting will be:
a. Observation of the Earth and other planets: climate change, ocean and
sea bed studies, land use monitoring, Earth's atmosphere, lessons from
other planets
b. Sun-Earth connection and the space environment: understanding the
Sun, impacts on the near-Earth environment, the magnetosphere, Sun and
climate, space weather.
c. Hazard warning and forecasting for Earth and space: storm and severe
weather forecasting, space dust and debris, hydrology, air pollution
d. Space and spacecraft technologies: communications, navigation,
cryogenics in space, spacecraft technologies, technology benefits for
science and applications, software, formation flying, miniaturization,
enabling role of satellites

Poster presentations are now invited for this meeting. academia,
industry and research institutions. Please send a title, authors and
abstract to rsspacemeeting@mssl.ucl.ac.uk by 15th September 2001. It is
intended to publish a book based on the proceedings.

A press conference will be held in conjunction with the start of the
meeting.
