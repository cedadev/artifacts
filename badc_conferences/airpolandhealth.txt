Air pollution and health

Some blame increases in asthma and allergies on rising levels 
of air pollution. Others claim that the air we breathe is much 
cleaner today, especially in comparison to the past, when smog 
would often settle over cities. How polluted is the air around
us? And what's causing a rise in asthma and allergies?
