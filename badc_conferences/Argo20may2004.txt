Agenda:

Trevor Guymer (IACMST): Welcome

Howard Freeland (Institute of Ocean Sciences, Canada): Argo as an Aid to Environmental Monitoring and Assessment - the example of the Gulf of Alaska

Brian King (Southampton Oceanography Centre): The detection of subsurface theta-S changes

Richard Wood (Met Office): Potential of Argo data for detection and attribution of oceanic climate change

Keith Haines (ESSC, University of Reading): Assimilating salinity and temperature data from Argo at ECMWF

Matt Martin (Met Office): The impact of Argo data on ocean forecasting

TEA

Elaine McDonagh (Southampton Oceanography Centre): Results from UK Argo in the Indian Ocean

Rebecca McCreadie (British Oceanographic Data Centre): Data from UK floats and the Southern Ocean Data Centre

Discussion on how to become involved in the UK Argo project led by Jon Turton (Project Co-ordinator)

Argo is a major international project to observe the oceans in a systematic way. The full array will consist of 3000 floats; to date, 1000 have been deployed. The UK is making a significant contribution to the programme, with funding from Defra, MOD and NERC.

The Forum will provide an excellent opportunity for all members of the UK marine community (whether from the research or operational, government or private sectors) to find out how they can benefit from Argo and become involved in the UK programme.
