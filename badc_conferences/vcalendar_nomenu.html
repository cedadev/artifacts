Click on the <img src="/graphics/misc/vcalendarsmall.gif"> icon to download
the selected event information to your computer in 
<a href="http://www.imc.org/pdi/">vCalendar</a> format. If you have a 
scheduling program which can understand vCalendar format, such as Microsoft 
Outlook, then the event will be automatically added to your calendar (you
will normally be prompted before this happens - choose Open).
<p>
If your browser has not been configured to handle vCalendar files then you may be
given the option of saving the file to disk as a '.vcs' file. If you save the
file then you can open it later from within a scheduling program which 
understands vCalendar format.
