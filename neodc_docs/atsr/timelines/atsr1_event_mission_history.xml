ATSR ICU correctly issued an EQSOL request to the OBC and ATSR was shut down.

Despite the cold-tip temperature reaching a low of 97.6K, the 12uM auto gain/offset loop still failed to lock, a fixed gain/offset of 36/0.45v was commanded at 11:45 UTC in the 12uM channel together with a data compression change to 10 bit for the 11/12uM channels. A second change of gain/offset to 26/0.4v was commanded at 16:40 UTC in an attempt to optimise performance. With the IRR the only instrument powered during this payload reactivation, it was evident that 2 to 3 degree cooler detector temperatures could be achieved for the nominal SSC settings.</event>
