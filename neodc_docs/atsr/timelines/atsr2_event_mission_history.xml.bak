This caused a de-pointing of the spacecraft platform which triggered a payload EQSOL (an automatic equipment safe switch off)
This occurred at 154:14:43:53 UTC causing an abrupt end of data collection.
Subsequent operations by ESOC to recover the platform in safe attitude control with the desired yaw steering mode (YSM) took some time.
The recovery of the IRR began at about 10:00 UTC on 8th June with an ATSR-2 restart. The scan mirror start up was uneventful and data collection of visible data using pixel map 14 began more or less straight away.
The IR detector cool down began at the same time and the detectors reached nominal (cold) values at ~82K by 16:30 UT"/></event>

It was decided to reset the ICU (Instrument Control Unit) software, this command though needed sanction from the GOME and MWR instrument teams.
All ATSR-2 instruments were commanded to STBY, the ICU reset issued and the IRR reconfigured. There was a period from approx. 12:30 UTC through to 18:30 UTC when data was non-nominal.
The reset was successful and immediately the gain/offset loops functioned correctly.

The ERS-2 spacecraft attitude is operating in Extra-Backup-Mode (i.e. no gyros). This will have a significant effect on ATSR-2 images, in particular the co-location of nadir and along-track views. ESA hope to improve the performance of the attitude control as the orbit behaviour becomes more understood. The aim is to attain optimum attitude control by June in readiness for the launch of ENVISAT-1 in July. To provide data for the orbit analysis, ESA will run the AMI instrument in wind-wave mode for an extended period. This means that there will be no ATSR-2 H-Rate data until 16 February (TBC). </event>
